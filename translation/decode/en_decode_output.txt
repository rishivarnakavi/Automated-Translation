through the adoption of the amendments , the majority of the commission were to use the original treaty of the maastricht treaty , which would only apply to the existing conventions which are part of the union ' s states
finally , the amendments are concerned with the powers of the budgetary authority .
the treaty of lisbon has been based on the basis of the common and social committee of economic affairs .
amendment no amendment proposes to be simplified .
the institutions are involved in the commission ' s assessment of the implementation of the committee on economic and economic affairs , which is also the case of the committee on the ombudsman .

i would like to point out , i should like to point out the committee ' s committee on budgetary and amendment 00 of the amendments tabled by the group of the european parliament , which i voted for the vote of the committee on the environment , the committee on budgets and the committee on the control of the committee on the control of the budget .
i would like to draw the attention of the commission ' s proposal for the commission , which has been presented to the proposal for the entry to the schengen procedure to the other institutions of the community .
this is a paragraph paragraph 0 of the protocol , which is the procedure for the procedure to control the work of the budget to work on other other institutions , which should be supported by the other amendments ,
the three issues are the specific issues of the countries of third countries and the countries of third countries , especially to the countries of the countries concerned with the need for the implementation of the programmes .
finally , i would like to end the final vote that we must vote on the first point , as the main aim of the committee on the control of the schengen procedure , and the other criteria that are to be implemented and the other powers of the european union and other institutions must be able to control .
i would point out to the commissioner ' s point of view of the commission , i would like to know that the commission will be able to present the amendments that the committee on budgets are the budgetary control

i therefore hope that this will be brief .
but i would like to thank you , especially , for the very very important and who , mr de de palacio , has done a very good job and a thorough deal of human rights .
the european institutions are sometimes less than the four reports and the most and more and more .
i would not like to congratulate the rapporteur , which has been a part of his own time to the house , to express the other amendments to the house .
i would like to remind you , mr president , that i think that the report has been based on a compromise group , among the group of the european party party .

as it said , the green paper is a new one of the financial year 0000 .
it is the case of the _UNK of the treaty of lisbon , the treaty of amsterdam or the maastricht treaty , and the possibility of the next to the next .



nobody knows .
if it is necessary to see the financial legislative procedure that we have to do , this is also a new , new legislative regulation .
the european union is to be aware of the european union ' s economic area of the european union , which is already known when the financial services are currently being involved .
it was a community which was not even a majority of the european parliament , and the majority of the committee on the accession and the accession of the country , as well ago , greece , portugal .

therefore , the commission , which i think that the commission has done the work of the new financial framework , which is necessary .
we have to know that the documents are not working on the right and we have , however , some of us who have been , but the number of the number of states .
however , these documents should be consulted and the dialogue and the european parliament should be open to a new financial agenda and the new transition .
absolutely absolutely .
another political point is the right to the point of view of the ombudsman ' s ombudsman .
parliament was a success , but the european parliament was able to provide a good mandate , but i would like to ask the house to provide the appropriate legal services that i am proposing to draft this resolution .
the independence of auditors is not the institution that the european parliament ' s budget is not .
if the committee on economic and economic affairs committee , the committee on budgets are still being held in a convention , and the role of the committee on the environment in the white paper is the first part of

therefore , the _UNK principle is a specific one .
i am perhaps the most of the draft draft resolution on the subject of the resolution .
on the other hand , the other points : the other , the most important and the other states : the stability of the euro and the stability of the euro , and the common system , and the common system of the common and two of the two institutions have been established by the _UNK of the _UNK and _UNK _UNK .


but we will be very clear that we expect the commission to present a european parliament that we are discussing that we are going to have a common europe and its own budget .
i also support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , and i should like to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , for the group of the european parliament ' s committee on the technical reform of the committee
as i am concerned , i am very concerned , i am also pleased with the commissioner ' s proposal for a proposal to provide the better and better support of the aid of the community and to help the help of the european union to help the growth and growth of europe .
i have to say that the commission has not yet been the very clear position on the matter .
the next debate in the last debate will be the commission in the very constructive way in the opening .
the issue also raised the agenda of 0000 and 0000 , but the commission has not yet been able to make the proposals in the specific framework .
something is something that is something else .
hence the commission that the commission has made its promises to make the promises made by the previous and the
the importance of the importance of the european union is to be a positive political signal to the opportunities of the countries of the european union and the central countries of the european union .
we are , of course , a proposal for a structural fund , as as as as as as other countries have already been able to provide the new structures and their administration , and the commission will be ready
at the same time , the court of auditors has already been adopted , because the amendments that are already being made will be able to see that the problems already have already been in the programme of the new

let us show the desire to express the enlargement of
we can go on the way to make the programme that we will make more effective and more effective .
mr president , i am pleased to be pleased to share the opinion of the committee on budgets which i support the proposal to be adopted by the proposal for the new social treaty .
this is the final proposal to amend the proposed procedure of the regulation on the subject of the commission , which was presented by the committee on the table , a study which was presented to the interinstitutional consultation consultation
the report has made the opinion of the commission to make the opinion of the european parliament , and the committee on the european parliament .
there is no fear and i am not personally .

the proposal to the proposed regulation is to be proposed , and the introduction of the treaty , which is the only possible solution to the treaty of the treaty , which is , of course , a regulation of the treaty of the european union , which , in 0000 , will be adopted by the treaty of the treaty of 0000 , the national community ' s proposal for the financial framework of the committee on fisheries ,
the commission can accept the various amendments tabled by the committee on budgets .
the amendments are 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , and the commission ' s proposal for the scope of the treaty of amsterdam ,
however , the commission is not only prepared to accept the amendments , but i would also like to add the amendments that are , in the same part , the main reasons for the fund , which is why the aim of the protocol is to be able to comply with the adoption of the protocol on the euro entry into force of the euro .
on amendment no amendment , and i would like to say that the reasons for the current and low levels of the number of cases are currently being imposed on the lack of the law of the rights of the rules of the budget , which is not at the moment ' s budget .
it is not possible to have a budget procedure in the area of the budget and budgetary reforms .
on the other amendments , 0 , 0 , 0 , 00 , 00 and 00 , and these are the same and financial instruments which have their own financial budget .
they must not be involved in the financial regulation , but the budget of the budget , but the general provisions of the special provisions should be applied .
on the basis of the proposed amendment on the common cooperation and cooperation , which can be achieved by the commission , and the council is to be able to implement the same and administrative process , with the administrative
on the amendment on the budget on the commission ' s own , the commission is not a question of the financial and financial rules between the institutions .
the commission is not in principle , in the capacity of the accession of the powers of the euro and may only be able to achieve the agreement between the institutions .

mrs lulling has raised the issue of the 00 and 00 00 committee on the budgetary control of the management of the management of the 0000 programme .
in the end of the commission , the council of the european council proposal on a framework of the possibility of the accession countries to be adopted by the eu and the acp countries , which will facilitate the management

debate is closed .

draft budget budget
the next item is the council proposal for the draft budget budget budget for 0000 .
mr president , ladies mr president , i am pleased to inform the house today on the results of the council ' s draft project on the budget and the 00 december 0000 to the commission .
however , i would like to make the final outcome of the conciliation council ' s last success , but we also need to improve the cooperation between parliament and parliament , and the commission .
the last year was already made , and the last year , which seems to be too long .
at the two meetings of the 00 and 00 september in the 00 september , i have been convinced by the opinion of the opinion , and i share the views of the views and understanding of the various points
another issue , however , is also a matter of meeting of the council meeting in the council of the council , which is a matter of a legal basis for the legal basis .

i would now like to refer to the budget for the 0000 budget , i should like to say that the main principles are set up for the council .
with the external plans to the next year , the commission will take into account the conclusions of the council of ministers in the european council and the council of the priorities .
we continue to continue to continue commitments in the structural fund and the structural funds , and the funding of
in the context of the areas of the community , the three countries in the budget and the financial funds have set up a series of priorities for the budget and the objectives of the budget , which are not just a political aspect of the development of the eu ' s budget .
the provisions contained in the interinstitutional agreement on the 0000 and 0000 agreement , in the case of 00 june 0000 , the european court of justice in the legal framework may be established .
furthermore , the administrative burden of the number of the number of areas were made in the process of the overall budget of the financial perspectives .
in the field of expenditure , the administrative expenditure will increase the total of the total , which does not mean the amount of the expenditure .
the new introduction of the new market , the requirement for the need to extend the specific requirements of the union ' s enlargement and the extension of the union ' s own policy on the construction of the construction
in this respect , the need to be given to the need to be made of the need to be made of the technical and technical methods of the work of the technical and efficient methods of the work and training of the systems , and the one of the most effective and the application of the existing rules of the member states , where they are particularly involved in the case .
the implementation of the adoption of the adoption of the legislative procedure will be the first reading : the implementation of the budget and the financial figures for the euro and the commission will be able to take the same time in the budget of the budget proposed by the commission .
with regard to the structural funds , the council has also been asked to support the commission ' s budget in the budget and the court of the court .
in the context of the monetary pact , the council decided to reduce appropriations appropriations and appropriations .
in the areas of the budgetary policies , the council decided to increase appropriations for appropriations , and to increase the appropriations for the procedures of the council .
finally , the budget expenditure is , in fact , a total of the total income of the total of its total .
as you have already already mentioned , the new rules of the treaty of the treaty of the treaty of the treaty of the schengen area , the principle of the schengen area , and the second framework of the second framework of the second application of the rule of law .
with the rights of the council , the council has also been involved in the council to adopt the adoption of the last year , the council of the financial control of the administrative administration .
the budget is still to be expected to be able to increase the budget , the 00 0 % of the budget appropriations , which is eur 0 . 0 0 million 0 . 0 million 0 . 0 million 0 . 0 million 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 .
the total amount of appropriations is therefore 00% of the community ' s gdp .
eur eur eur eur eur eur eur eur eur eur eur eur high , eur high , the eur high reference to the financial perspectives for the areas of the external policies and the external policies of the union .
i would like to end by the first of all my colleagues , the european parliament delegation to participate in the discussions on the meeting of the council of the european parliament to draw up the draft budget project .
i would be pleased to continue to work with the council , with the committee on the cooperation and the committee on budgets , and i would like to say two thanks for the committee on the environment and the 0000 and the portuguese budget .
i hope that the success of the lisbon budget and the budget programme is the same priority for the budget for the 0000 budget .

mr president , 0000 ' s draft budget budget is very much enough .
one only one thing , the only budget convergence of the broad convergence of the community budget budget .
the commission has been the council and the commission to comply with the requirements of the union and the european union ' s recommendations on the subject of the _UNK and _UNK projects .
the commission is proposing to the regulation , which will be a supplementary priority for the commission to take into account of the final period , in order to give the commission to the end of 0000 .

however , when the last year we have seen that , despite the current developments in the area of the euro , there are still a lot of money in the area of the funds .
in the structural perspective , structural funds proposed in the budget for the appropriations proposed by the commission , the funding of the needs of the needs of the funds to be taken into account is clearly defined .
the 0 , the 00 , the internal policy , which is often the result of the commission ' s proposals , and even less than the 0000 budget .
sometimes , sometimes , is a problem that , as far as the council ' s proposals are concerned , the council ' s proposals and the small and medium-sized enterprises .
the proposal that the limit of the limits are under line with the rules of the budget , but i am not satisfied with the conclusions of the general budget for the 0000 and that of the european minimum system
finally , the policy of the budget , the first and the first time we have , for the budget , have been proposed by the budget budget .
it is clear that the general review of the european union should be extended to the council , and the commission will not be able to extend the cooperation of the european parliament ' s operational cooperation and the european
it is important for us to be the council that the funding of the funding and the funding of the budget , and the other costs will be increased in the area of the other external cooperation .
above all , the budget for the community budget is a significant step forward in 0000 .
it is not good for us to do the budget for the next year , but also the scope of the next few months will be able to take a further framework for the next financial framework .
mr president , i should like to say the first two amendments to the council and the commission for the first time , which i would like to congratulate the commission and parliament , on the basis of the council , to the legal framework for the framework of the committee on the basis of the framework , and the way that we have to be discussed in the context of the next .
first of the first time that the committee on the years have not been able to work in the council , but i would like to make the agreement with the council in the european parliament and the council on 00 0 and 00 . 0 . 0 . m .
then the budget will be given its own responsibility .
secondly , the importance of not only the next and but also the outcome .
the presidency has also been able to support the presidency , and i hope that the same will be in the same meeting in the next and the same conclusions in the framework of 0000 and the agenda 0000 .
after the time of the day that we are now waiting for the time , and i hope that the time for the time is , however , a great deal of time , but the time is still not

the first time i was in the first place that the first international court was the first to say that the financial crisis will be able to produce a new financial perspective and the new financial year , which will
i would therefore like to say , in the committee on the budget , on the budget , for the budget for the budget for the 0000 budget programme , as the amendments made by the committee on the agenda , the agenda will be included in the report , and i would like to say that the content of the content of the content is the most important and the flexibility of the services .
if the need to be made to the procedure of the procedure to be made to the principle of the budget and the implementation of the expenditure , the level of the community ' s expenditure would be in the area of the member states , in the context of the budget in the context of the next year .
this is already because we have already taken this debate because the general review of the first reading in the


it was a great mistake that the council has not yet been able to make the first reading of a clear policy on the area of agricultural policy .
however , we are all aware that we will be able to take the codecision procedure that we agreed in conciliation and the conciliation agreement will be based on a positive basis of the commission ' s proposal .
in this way , the results of the commission must be in the area of the impact of the sector in the field of the use of the use of the use of the use of these funds .
so we have already done this year with the proposal for the year 0000 .


last year , the last year , the _UNK of the _UNK of the french government of the 00 nations of ministers , the council of 00 million 00 million , was in a sector of agriculture .
the other years of the past and the last year , the commission has been able to do so in the way that the rules of the regulation or the regulations on the regulation are not covered by the regulation
secondly , i would also like to say that the commission has been very clear to us , and the member states that are now being used to export products and the export of the sugar market , and the european market , which is now the market , is still being used to export and to the extent .
it cannot be a policy of the community ' s policy to prevent the community ' s own community fleet through the distribution of the fleet .
it is not a new and _UNK , and therefore , in the case of the united states , in the case of the 0000 and the following the current programme , the objective of the agreement will be to ensure a reduction in the budget for the 0000 sector in the budget .
there is a different link between 00 0 and 0
we have already discussed the house in the house on the increase in 0 .

the rate of the gap is the figure between the 00% and 00% of the 00 % of the 00 % system , the appropriations for the payment of the appropriations .

the result of the fact , which is the only possible thing , which has not been achieved , is still in a case of the fact possible , for example , in the member states , that the commission has already been able to use the proposals , in particular , in the past few years , in the first rate of 0 . 0 0 .
it is necessary to mention the 00 and 00 000 ( 0 ) , for example , to be used to the extent that the programme has been used to the other and the other , the way that the programme for the promotion of the european union should be supported in the promotion of the european union .
the millions of medicines have been made , however , because they have not been able to find the necessary changes because they have been so much available to be expected , and i would like to add my additional
no 000 million have been paid to the farmers , and i would like to reduce the reduction of 0 0 000 000 , which is to increase the level of 0 0 .


you have not been able to make the council that the council has already proposed a budget budget , which would be more additional than eur 000 million for the programme for the 0000-0000 programme .
we must not be sure that the period that the funds will be not available to be implemented in 0000 , because 0000 , the 0000 budget programme , which are not available to be approved by 0000 , the budget of the 0000 budget programme , which is why the 00 year 0000 , which are not available to be allocated to the budget of the 00 year , which is why the budget of 00 000 000 funds
in other words , we have to say 00 0 of the 00 years , which is not yet available to the list of 00 . 0 . 00 . 00 . 00 . m .
now , 0 may now be allocated to the other ecu the money allocated to the funding of the funding and the funding for the other groups , for example .
this has nothing to do with financial policy and is not the case in the past .
it was made a decision of urgency , and it is now a way of the process and the process
parliament ' s legislative decision , not least , is proposed by the draft budget procedure , and the commission proposal for the budget and not even to be a procedure for the procedure .
we are now not clear , and we are not saying that the countries are in the countries that are not possible to allow countries to be able to make the same time that the funds are available to the commission , as it is necessary to use the resources available to the end of the year , and the resources will not be available to the resources that will be used .
we will therefore hope that the new people will not be able to spend 0 million 000 000 million in the community ' s special group .
finally , the issue of the field of research is the subject of the research .
mr president , i know that the council of ministers , the agenda 0000 budget guidelines for the budget agenda 0000 , the budget of the budget area , which is a budget category of budget expenditure .
we know that there is a lot of the 00 , 00 years of 00 years , which is why the 00 years of parliament has been tabled , which has been proposed by parliament .
i would be very grateful to your voice expressed by the 00 00 00 september .

of course , the council , and the council , and the council , will be able to make a compromise decision and make the compromise that we cannot achieve that , but we will have a compromise between the 00 and 00 and 00 , 00 and 00 .
you know that the important issue is a significant financial instrument , since 0000 , the budget for 00 0 . 0 % is to be used in research .
with regard to the subject of the funding for the research and the resources for the research and the activities of the programme for the framework of the framework programme , which is a result of the implementation of the legislative framework , which is based on the basis of the research and , on the basis of the research and research .
therefore , i can only say the fact , but i am also aware of the fact for the presidency to be able to say the fact for the council to finance its financial services , for example the agenda 0000 for the next year 0000 to be submitted to the next year 0000 , and i shall be more brief for the budget for the next year .
in my opinion , i can only express my comments on the budget for the 0000 budget and to the scientific and technological .
mr president , i would also like to congratulate the presidency of the council and the council that we have been so much welcome .
the commission ' s statement is to be a very positive statement that the committee of the committee on the internal market , which has been achieved in the outcome of the outcome of the outcome of the budget budget

firstly , the european union has already been said , and it has to be said , and the european union has to be able to set up a ' not ' but not to a point of view , but we must also move towards a decision to change the agenda and the next year 0000 .
i believe the world ' s joint partnership is a good basis : we agree on the basis of the
but i want to stress the fact that we are a more important and one step in that we have been able to have a successful and 00 years ago in the years .
during the european parliament , parliament had a political opportunity
i am talking about here , at least .
the committee on budgets said the budgetary point of view of the 0 0 0 0 category 0 .
i believe it is not a way of the presidency to accept the financial analysis of the financial resources in the community ' s budget .
on 0 0 , i should like to say parliament ' s parliament .
0 is a _UNK of a _UNK , a _UNK _UNK .
in the context of the council , the council has to be able to use its own budget for 0000 , the budget for the european parliament .
i would like to say to the council that mr von von wogau has said his own report .
i am pleased that we are pleased with the european parliament and the council , and i agree with the rapporteur , with the priorities that we are in the european parliament and the rapporteur , and i agree with the rapporteur : the _UNK of the _UNK and _UNK _UNK _UNK _UNK _UNK _UNK .
another aspect is also the agreement in which the council has reached the agreement on the agreement in the council , with the agreement on the economic policy , in the first reading , in the first reading , to support the initiative in the first 00 and the first to the support of the council , to the council ' s proposal .
the european council ' s second point of paragraph 0 , which says the point , which is specifically to be mentioned by the groups , and the minority , with disabilities , with disabilities .
at the same time , i also hope , and i have also asked the council to accept the legal court of the european union and the court of these programmes , which are the legal basis for the legal
finally , i should like to say the 0 0 0 0 . i agree with the commission ' s opinion on the budget , which has also been included in parliament .

on the other hand , i should like to say the second question of the fifth programme , and the first time of the new parliament , i have to say another point of parliament ' s question : the
the company has now , with its own part , must be able to comply with the rights .
the parliament ' s parliament will be able to use the process of the future and to make the budget for the next few years , the commission ' s proposals are at the expense of the decision .
mr president , i am pleased to hear the commission ' s committee on the president of the committee on the european parliament and the council of the council , and i would like to welcome the commission ' s proposal for the 0000 period , and i would like to see the commission that the council has been working for the end of the work of the united states and the work that we have to do with the
in the annual financial year , the costs of eur 0 and 0 0 , the eur 0 billion , a eur eur 0 million in the euro .
last year , i believe the council has taken a very important measure to the council , to introduce a number of administrative bodies , to introduce the administrative system of the year , to increase the budget of the last year , even if the number of cases were often inadequate .
the council has been quite much accepted by the same example of the commission , which is a very low rate , as the commission has reached , for the other 00 % of the european parliament , and the other and other , 00 and 00 % of the other institutions , and the other .
in this regard , it is worth that the european parliament was a state which is only 00% of the total rate of 0% , 00% , 00% , with the percentage rate .
the question of the report is to be prepared to work with the staff of the european union , even more than the result of the budgetary process of the treaty of amsterdam , and the majority of the treaties
in particular , the first reading of the package of the budget was to be created , and the creation of the commission will be able to change the creation of the new procedures in the commission ' s proposal for the new and administrative framework of the commission ' s proposal for the other infrastructure to the environment and the other .
in the course of the council , the council adopted the council ' s amendments to the council , and i am therefore concerned , i would like to mention the most important decisions that was taken by the council
i am in the opinion of the commission , i would like to say that the commission has been able to make the final use of the new introduction of the treaty , which is to say a new approach to the treaty , which is the first time that we have to adopt a new approach to the council , which is the case for the two institutions , the council , for the other institutions , to the
i am very much that i am right to say that , although i am not right to say , i would like to ask you to see the fact that the council has not yet been more flexible , and the more appropriate and more qualified majority of the institutions , which is why the commission has more than the council , and the other institutions , which has been made in the process of the process , has
when the two committee were concerned with the committee on budgets and economic affairs , the council of ministers have already changed , but the amsterdam treaty , and the amsterdam treaty , is the same and two of the two amendments to the committee on the basis of the two .
the objective of the development and cooperation of the member states must be able to make the same possible progress , and to the extent that we must continue to make the necessary progress on the basis of the existing trade policy , which must be made to the end of the process of the two parties , which is not to be used to the court of the court of the committee on the basis of the same and
the court of the 00 states , which is the only way of the court of the 00 % of the european union , is the only way of the budget , because the budget has been submitted to the court of auditors for the budget programme , and the budget has already been made to the extent of the financial perspectives .
as the council , parliament must be able to take the way forward to the end of the process of the aim of the implementation of the budget to the additional budget and additional payments in the new member states
finally , on the european parliament , the council of the agreement states agree on the basis of the agreement
at the same time , the court of the court of the court has been based on the basis of the agreement , and the one has been based on a good basis of the analysis of the criteria , and the criteria of the criteria for the criteria to the criteria of the criteria for the other criteria to the authorities and the other institutions have to be involved .
in the first point , i would like to say the fact to be a parliamentary institution : the parliamentary parliamentary debate on the financial changes in the previous court of the court .
i think it is right to say that the budget of the budget has just been given to the budget , which is the only budget of the financial interest , which has only to be added to the budget
the council also agreed to accept the council ' s court with the court of the court of the ombudsman .
that is the council ' s view to the fact that the situation is to be made in the area of the greater increase in the area of the democratic powers of the council , in the case of the procedure , the council is not fully accepted in the first reading .
mr president , ladies with the honourable members , i have heard the comments expressed by mrs palacio and the commissioner ' s remarks in the council ' s conclusions of the draft budget project .
you can be sure that the council will have to look forward to the council ' s discussions .
in particular , i have noted the fact that you have had to see that you have received the possibility of the commissioner when the quotas is concerned .
i also noted that the proposed proposal should be used for the budget for 0000 .
of course , the council has already expressed the case of the programme for the programme .
in this respect , i must say , and i must say the budget for 0000 , and the council budget for the whole budget for the whole programme .
however , the very significant amount of the budget is to be achieved in the last year , the programme for the programme has been very successful .
in the context of the council , the council is currently considering a proposal for a second period , which is the first time for the 0000-0000 programme for 0000-0000 , with a number of funds for the budget .
with regard to the programme , the council has shown its difficulties with the fact that the process has been made , and it is the council that parliament is working in its effective operation .
therefore , i hope that the council will make the final review of the new financial rules , and the rules of the financial and financial procedures , in particular , to ensure the implementation of the appropriations for the use of the funds , for example , is to be used .
this will be expected to make improvements in the framework of the programme .
i also noted the importance of the solution to the future of research funding .
i can only assure you the commissioner is doing this in the long term programme for the framework of the framework for the framework and the right and good framework of the budget for the 0000 budget .
finally , i have just said that the council is not a good and a proposal for the european council and also to be a general and more important conclusions in the council ' s discussions .
i would like to start again , i would like to thank parliament for the excellent cooperation in the european parliament and the budgetary procedure that i hope that the future will be in future .

legal basis and implementation
the next item is the report ( a0-0000/0000 ) by the committee on the environment , on behalf of the committee on the interinstitutional agreement , on the interinstitutional agreement between parliament and the commission on the legal framework of the european union and the commission .
mr president , the first time is not to be the subject of the legal framework for the institutions and the european parliament in general .
i think we have been in the situation of the situation in 0000 , and we have now been a time that we have finally been able to have been able to have been able to have been made .
i would like to remind the previous and the council ' s resolution on the basis of the treaty for the legal framework for the council , and the council has been discussed in the context of the council , and the council , and i would like to see that the european parliament has been a serious debate on the basis of the people that the european parliament had to be held in the face of the situation in
it is therefore , however , the debate that the council has a very important issue , and the way to which the european parliament can be able to take the action of the next future and to the european
we must not forget the programmes that have been spent in the period of the european union , for example , in the framework of the period of the convention , for example , in order to establish a joint framework for the various bodies and the framework for the framework of the european union and other areas of the framework in the context of the framework .

these are factors that we have to consider that , as it was a matter of the opinion that we have had to be seen , but that is why the commission would have a good idea , which would be a result of the fact that , as a result of the majority , it would be a good thing , but i would say that the two people in the world were very important , but i believe
we are facing a situation which is now a situation which will be faced with the situation and will be resolved by the way that we will have to resolve the situation and the way that we have been faced
the agreement is , in the course of the community , to increase the budget of the budget and the adoption of the legislative action , and the adoption of the legislative action proposed by the commission , and the actions of the various actions and the commission will be able to use the activities of the activities of the activities of the community to be able to exercise their administrative activity .
it is not easy to allow them to be able to be able to ensure and the power and the right to have the right to have been used and to have the right to have been used .
as the council of the council , the council will have to establish the necessary possible possible and effective use of the new mechanisms of the programmes , and to establish the necessary possible and effective programmes of the programmes , and the adoption of the specific programmes , such a new basis of the programmes and programmes , and the two programmes , such a specific basis , should be taken to the current actions of the european union
this agreement also states that a common level of subsidiarity is also a very important matter , and we must also be able to respond to the best possible way .
mr president , i would like to make the point of the fact that we have to make the utmost and clear steps that we have made the aim of the european union to achieve the objectives of the european union and the objectives of the three and the most effective and effective european union ' s citizens .
i think that the future , in future , if the future is to be able to do its future , the right to ensure that the system is also necessary and also necessary , and it is also necessary
if it is , in fact , that the situation is that the future , and the need to be implemented in the future , are the necessary and effective use of the european funds that are necessary to ensure that the conditions are in place for the best and future of the european institutions , which will be able to be able to ensure that the council will be able to achieve that , in the same way ,
mr president , i have been in many years and have been raised by the legal issue .
as the court of the european court of the european court of justice , i would like to say a question of the fact that the commission will still be able to make the same time a general budget of
the negotiations on the new association of the new alliance will be called for the introduction of the open .
the joint contact of the union is being held by the council of the council to set up the draft budget and the most important contribution to the council of the major discussions .
all these efforts - and i hope - not least - the support of the delegation of the 00 june and the june of the interinstitutional agreement on the basis of a clear , in the short term .
in conclusion , the agreement will allow the use of the budget for the budget and the legal basis for the various member states to be involved .
the framework cooperation cooperation cooperation cooperation between the european parliament and the court of justice , as as as as as as as as as we can , is the best practice in the practice .
on the council , the council has already taken note of the conclusions of the court of the court of the court of justice , which is already being submitted to the court of the court of justice in the budget and the budget , which have already been rejected , but which is based on the basis of the legal basis .
the council is also aware of the commission ' s proposal to establish the framework of the council , and the commission , as a result of the other measures , to include the protection of the european parliament , and to include the most serious and vulnerable measures against the protection of the roma and the victims of the fight against the violence and the measures of the european civil and civil security and measures to the monitoring and
with regard to the budget for the budget and the budget , which has been proposed by the european parliament , but we have not yet been able to have been able to take the decisions on the basis of the decision to be able to take a decision to the legal basis of the use of the european parliament .
i can assure you , commissioner , already in the presidency that we have taken steps to take in the conciliation process as soon as possible as possible .
with regard to the budget which has not been proposed by the commission , which has not been proposed by the commission and the council , which has already been proposed by the commission , which has been agreed to date for the previous commitments to the member states , to which the commission has already decided to adopt a decision on the application of the existing legal sanctions , which is to be possible to avoid any possible and
this should be based on the basis of the mechanism , and we must ensure that the funds for the period are already necessary and before 00 june 0000 had been submitted to date .
finally , the social protection of the social system , which is the result of the amsterdam treaty , will be decided to take a decision to adopt a legal basis .
i would like to thank parliament for the commission and also to cooperate with the issue of the matter .

mr president , mr de de den de den den statement : the proposal for the directive is a good and less difficult and the necessary political situation has been made .
i am going to say that i am not voting for this parliament because this report is not accepted .
i shall be speaking to the two members in the chamber : the debate on the one - in the house - the two and the other - is the one - i have to say the group of the

i think that the best and better work of the period of the people of the european parliament , the work of the resolution on the part of the resolution .
so we have to say that we have done in the past , which has been the most important and that we have done for this .
i also have to say , when we had to conclude the agreement between the conciliation and the commission , i hope , i hope , will be the council of the council .
the presidency had been committed to resolving this issue .
since mr president , i was told the commissioner for the president-in-office of the council , i have said that the presidency has been very much to say , and i have been aware of the fact that the presidency has been right to have the floor , and i should like to say that the one has been given to the one side of the single member state .
having said , it was a good and a great deal of discussion in the negotiations that could be made in a decision , and the fact is a little of the money .
i hope that never never needed to be changed because , after it , it is not .

when we were following these three points , i would like to see that the three legal treaty are the good basis for the future and the future , but the future of the 0000 problem .
i therefore welcome the start of my speech .
mr president , i have to say mrs van den and mr van den den den den group , on behalf of my group , to take the issue of the house , and i think this report is a very important one .
we need to be clear , from the commission , and we will be able to go into detail .
four sectors .
i would like to hear the one that i have seen that in the way that we are in the face of the problems that we have to be resolved , and we will have to respond to the commission

but we need to support the commission ' s specific action to the commission and the member states to make the same steps that are particularly important and the social aspects of the trade and social services , which we have not yet been a good idea , but we have not seen that the idea of the funds should be used .
on the 0 and 0 000 000 , which are , in the course of the 00 , will not be able to spend 0 , and we are going to spend the money from the money ?
in the areas where we have been in the case of the market , such as the one and the most concerned , the roma and the most of the funds have been used .
it is very small and small and even more expensive and that we have had no problems with the many times , which have been spent on many of the sums of money .

but there are many very few points , which i would like to say , however , to ensure that the commission is not prepared to provide such funds such to these funds .
i hope that we can answer our information with this morning tomorrow .
i have a final comment : i would like to raise the progress of the report and the consensus on
some amendments have been tabled or four of the four amendments , which are not being taken .
my group would be our group not to vote but let us not accept the amendments .
i do not want to say that the content of the amendments are not content by the content of the report , but i believe that the report is the only way .
mr president , i would like to express the fact that the solution that the problem of the problem is a problem of the two member states , which have been set up by the committee on the agreement we
i believe parliament has made greater progress in the context of the european parliament in relation to the framework of the framework of the framework of the treaty and not only in the context of the political and the reasons for the future , but also the political reasons for the financial resources .
therefore , if it is not the case of the council of the council to start the presidency of the council , the council of the council , the presidency of the council , to the summit , to the fact that the political summit in the past the case of the past , were not to be resolved by the previous political and economic point of view of the fact that the two member states were not a simple
it was a very bad situation that was made wrong , but i would like to say that the impression was not only a good and less political solution but also a technical and technical process .
i think that was not enough , but i was not simply asking it .
the council will increase the pressure and pressure on the council , which was prepared to do so .
in this case , the european parliament and the commission can agree with this outcome .
of course , it certainly certainly .
three countries are now in order to establish a clear and clear conditions , and i think we have to say the european parliament .
however , it should not be too difficult to consider that too difficult conditions .
in my view of the committee on agriculture , i believe the commission has given the view of the proposal to the court of the 0000 committee , on the proposal for a european budget to be able to work
we also agree with the council , we also have a great deal of the fact that the common position of the european parliament is still in the opinion of the justice and the commission ' s intention to make
however , some people are trying to find a little of the clear attitude that we are currently in this
i would like to ask you once again to ask you to see the more and more careful and that we have to work , and also to put the necessary action to the 0000 sector .
indeed , the funds made to be made available for the 0000 and the funds for the ngos , and the other organisations , and the money that have been made available .
i would like to thank very much welcome and welcome that we have a long and a lot of work on the subject we have already discussed on this subject .
in germany , there are people who are afraid of the day that they can solve problems .

the greek minister also has the hope , and the hope that has been achieved successfully .
( applause )


the political aspect is the most important thing : the commission is a great deal of the fact : the council is to see that parliament and the council and the commission , and the rapporteur , has to be welcomed , and the commission has been right .
unfortunately , the very serious nature of the council has been a matter of a democratic body .

the decision was the council , and the other and the _UNK of the council , which will be a few months ago , could not allow me to make the decision that could be made more than the council
this is part of the general debate on the subject of the single five and five million days .
but the political aspect is the council and parliament is being treated in this matter .
the second point is the institutional agreement that the council has adopted , and parliament must also approve that parliament has adopted its initiatives and the council , and the european parliament , to its citizens .
i have a question to ask the commission a second question in the plenary session .
that agreement will be a good success in the future , the commission will take the political position forward .
now we are going to see that the commission will be able to make the commission a legal basis that will allow the commission to make a proper future procedure that is necessary to ensure the codecision procedure ?
can you say that article 000 is being made in article 000 , because the rule of democracy is democracy
i cannot understand that , in the commission , the commission , the commission , is the largest _UNK of the euro , should be allowed to be the rule of the treaty of parliament ' s powers to the
mr president , the court of justice has been the court of the commission , the commission has been in line with the budget budget , for ecu 0 billion .
it is therefore necessary to have a special effort to work and organisations such organisations and the fight against poverty and poverty , and combating poverty , combating human rights and democracy .
the great work of the european people ' s party , the group of the european parliament , has also been agreed to work on the interinstitutional agreement , which has been agreed to the interinstitutional agreement .

however , i am pleased to support the fact that the people of the european union and the fight against the measures are still being taken , and i would like to ask the commission to take a further step , and i would like to ask the united states to be a new approach to the fight against the international humanitarian aid programme .
my request was made to the fact that the fight against poverty is not the most effective and the reduction of the funds is not in the area of the funds .
we are unacceptable that because we are unacceptable , because there are many people who are fighting against .
this really is that we need to review this situation , and we will have a new strategy on combating
in conclusion , the use of the european union ' s choice to the mechanisms of the european market will allow us to use the solutions , and we would like to make the opportunity to make the debate on the subject of the debate , which will be the subject of the debate and the attention of the citizens of the member states .

i believe that the commission is a good and good and the council and the council , and the commission .

it is true , in some time , a great deal of pressure on the government to support the court of the court that it is not being taken .
i believe the negotiations with the countries and the trade and the union , with the same reason , to the extent of the fact to the extent of the development of the public and the greater use of the use of the system that we need to strengthen the legal basis .

only when the agreement on the basis of the legal system , it will be possible to be able to
the european parliament must now be ready to create a joint and legal framework for the european union and to the council and the council to act and reject the european union ' s action .
for the other hand , i would like to point out , mr president , as the rapporteur , in the committee on the legal reform , the legal responsibility of the commission , in the framework of the rules of the convention , is to be able to make the proposals that the council will be able to take the necessary decisions on the basis of the council ' s institutions .
i hope that the future will be good to the commission with the good cooperation in this .
now i am concerned that the debate on the subject of the council , although the future is not yet a matter of the fact that the majority of the convention , which is not a case of the new and many of the previous elections , but i have to say that the result of the new funds has been made , however , because we have never been able to have the resources available .
on other reasons , it is still possible to be able to do so , in my case , in the case of the european parliament ' s youth and youth .
i would be sure if you can be able to tell you , mr president , we will be able to make the opportunity to make the commission ' s debates , because we are going to be able to discuss the political issues that we have heard in this house , because we are not going to see the same thing that we are going to vote on this year , because it is not only the commission to
i believe that the necessary thing should be possible to
mr president , the most of the italian parliament , even before the last few months , were the first and difficult of the institutions , the citizens of the institutions of the community have a fundamental human rights .
if the budget is not completed , it is not enough , but it is the case .
the report is a common and human and human rights and the agencies for the agencies and the staff of the member states , and i am speaking to the press for the internet , to the question of the matter that i am talking about the subject and the _UNK and the _UNK which we are now being called for .
i am sorry to say that the court of justice had to withdraw the court and what happened .

indeed , what is what we have done , because we have a new government in the uk , not the uk , for this .
i think that a government is a very different and that many of the two parties have been .
we are talking about the languages of the czech minority to be a common and common position with our own


mr president , i always have to say two words with the two and two , but the fact is
mr president , i think this point is still some of some difficulties .
firstly , on legal basis .
i agree with that , i have noted that the rights and the issue is a matter of the people of europe .
it is not possible to say that the eur 000 million has been spent on 000 million and the money for the programme , which is not even possible to be able to be able to give the amount of money , which is a very important problem for the possibility of a legal basis .
mr president , i think we must be a good agreement here , although we can always agree with the fact that we are even more efficient and even if we are to see that parliament is more than the

we need to take a decision on the issue , not a question of a complex structure .


you are , ladies with the one of the most of the institutions , but the treaty is not the case that the legal framework clause is not sufficient .
legal basis has been the financial and financial council of parliament to the council .
it is , in the course of the fact , we are all about that .
on the basis of the _UNK and _UNK _UNK have been a very serious one .
this was also possible to be completely acceptable .
we are now facing a legal basis that we can accept that , although we are in a position , although the european parliament is in itself a budget and the budget , not least .
it is a situation and must be a very important step towards the people of europe .

mr president , the confidence of citizens in the european union is the greatest responsibility for the union to respond to the problems facing the citizens of the citizens .
unfortunately , the confidence of this has been very long
the court of the court of the court of the last decision , the commission decided to take part of the decision , and the way of the confidence of the european union .
at the same time , the legal system of the number of 000 million people would be in favour of the 0000 development fund , and the resources of the ngos are still being supported .
the citizens cannot be able to use the use of the use of the funds that can be used and the use of the use of the funds and the use of the use of the funds and the use of the activities and the use of the activities of the fight against the activities of the convention and the promotion of the minority , and the importance of the importance of the fundamental importance .

i hope that the council will also take the opportunity to parliament and to the council .
unfortunately , we often have seen the commission with a greater approach to parliament with the council .

mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report that i have made a number of things that i have been discussing that , in the past , we have had a lot of things to be very difficult and that we will be able to discuss the world .
this has also been discussed in the commission .
i would just like to say a few words about the council , and i should like to say that the council and the council have not been able to discuss the political consequences of the council and the commission on the security of the european union and the security of the european union and also to the human rights and the mediterranean and the mediterranean in asia .
human rights are fundamental issues in the debate , and the commission is now in the debate that we are now discussing the issue of the european parliament , and i am pleased to say that the commission is now a matter of the european union , which is the most important issue in the european union .
on the one hand , it is a step in the way of the european union , and the other institutions in the european union , and also to the other sectors , in other areas , and the other and the other , in the interests of the european union , and i am also convinced of the right of the democratic democratic right of the world ' s democratic state .
i hope that the council will have to be able to support the reforms that are the best and good cooperation and the commission ' s good role , but i would also like to know that the commission will be very much more closely in the same and the same and the same and the same reports will be to pay the same treatment of the eu , particularly in the case of the eu , and also to

mr president , i am pleased to be pleased with the conclusion that i agree with .
i would , however , like to add some comments about the views expressed by the speakers .
i do not agree with the council that can only be able to take decisions in the council , and the case that there is a pressure in this area .
i have to say that , i believe the council can accept the original statement of the european court of justice , which is the case that the council has not yet been able to do so , which is the very difficult way to find the right to the joint and constructive agreement with the council .

the first of the first attention , i have already mentioned the attention of the people of europe that was a great deal of the european parliament , because it is still in the budget of budgetary budgets .

this is why the problem has been a problem of 00 years ago , and the council , and parliament , between the council , the commission and the cooperation between the union .
i believe that , for reasons , it was a solution for a solution .
i am very pleased that this will hopefully approve .
mr president , the agreement on the constitutional treaty on the basis of the three countries are not a very important period of the 0000 budget , because it was not a first time since the 0000 ii was the

the numbers of the budget have been a higher proportion of the community budget .
this is because we have achieved the progress achieved by the institutional powers of the institutional powers .
the agreement will strengthen the success of the negotiations in negotiations with the interinstitutional agreement .

at the same time , the european parliament ' s position is also in the final attempt to make the court of the court that have been decided against the application of the community ' s community budget .
the agreements are not only about the institutions and , above all , the ngos and the ngos .
it has been a significant step in the process of the commission and the government to have a clear , clear and clear of the importance of the action which is being taken .
in these countries , the people will be able to be able to be in a budget , not least in the budget of the budget .
we must take action and not all .
the future will be in the decision-making procedures to be simplified and clearer .




i want to see .

with regard to the budget budget , the budget budget is very tight .
the budget budget , the budget have been the last few months .

the agreement of the agreement by the president of the european parliament , and the last two october , a new example of the last and more important and more important action for women , including women , and the fight against human rights and actions , and the fight against the human rights and action in the fight against the european union .
the procedures of the procedure for the creation of a voluntary service for the disabled and the acp countries for the eu has been able to take part in the implementation of the programmes .

with regard to the budget and the social fund that we are going to have the social and climate change that we will be discussing at the meeting tomorrow .
i propose a communication on the commission ' s actions to implement the recommendations for the treaty of amsterdam .

obviously , there are still problems in some new markets , such a regime , which is the commission ' s failure to avoid the court that have been made .
but we have agreed to meet the problems that will have to be achieved at the end of the year 0000 , the budget will be in the next budget for the budget .
if the following and the following and the commission has already been able to monitor , and it is also a strong and strong way to ensure the national and social measures .
the services of the services of the 00 000 million 000 million are not a limited amount of ecu five million , which is only a year which is not only available to the end of the year .
we will now respond to the questions raised by mr van den and mr swoboda on the subject of the social market .
there is no question of the council , but we are talking about a series of funds , and the funding of the funding of the funding for the action plan , which is the same action for the various
the other questions raised by the budget and budgetary lines are the first ones .
it is not easy to understand that the people of this project is not enough .
in any case , the council of the council are certain of the council ' s proposal to be flexible , and the council is to make the process of the budget procedure , and to the extent of the
thirdly , in order to put the floor , i say , our attention to the needs of the institutions to be taken into account .
i would like to say to the members of the members who have been involved , and i personally have to be able to contact with the services involved .
it is the best way to see rapid action .
the framework has been proposed .
i have good news for the commissioner for the subject of the languages of the languages , i can say to the words of the commission with the words .

i am in favour of the european parliament , which was a total of ecu 000 .
i am very happy to propose the commission ' s proposal , and i would like to assure you , commissioner , to the honourable member states to decide that parliament will be able to accept the problem of the
i would like to conclude by mr president , mr president , on behalf of the committee on budgets , and the president of the committee , who made the right to the agreement that we have reached the agreement
emissions of vehicles and the motor and waste of the

mr president , i can say what has already been said , namely the other and industrial industry .
this was a very constructive debate , but we have now been a good step .
personally , at least , i was not very concerned about the fact that the commission is in agreement with the other and the other .
for the whole of the whole , we must also be able to express the joint parliamentary and political views in the way that we have reached this package , which has been very much high in the interests of
i wish to express my thanks to all of the members of the spirit that we have worked for the compromise that has been made in parliament ' s proposal .
the point was the proposal by the commission for two years ago to set up the common energy policy for the same year 0000 .
i am not sure that parliament has been in the council , with the improved improvements , with the commission ' s proposals .
the fact for the services of the european union , for the same time , we will be able to ensure that the safety of the directive will be able to make a more effective and more competitive and that we should have to do something that we have to do with the impact on the energy sector .

the conciliation committee has made the necessary flexibility of the quality of the relevant resources for the 0000 and 0000
this is a very important step forward , because we are actually able to produce that production can be used in production production .
although the whole industry is concerned , the european car industry has to make the necessary means of the more stringent standards of the nuclear and the fact for the most important and not to the industry .
the institutions of the institutions now know what we are now going to save the oil industry in 0000 .
during the past , the past the fact was to have the courage to pay the price of the economy in the course of the difficult economic authorities to resolve the problems of the sector .
however , we have succeeded in the fact that we have already been able to make the industry a high amount of investment in industry .
if the sector is to be reduced , the production of production can therefore be done , and the whole of the entire people , in the case of the rules of the environment , are still more stringent .
for the conciliation , we have also agreed to implement the commission ' s programme in the programme .
in the light of the first analysis , i would like to point out that a very complex analysis of the budget and the commission is very different , but the other groups of parliament will have to make the
we have seen that the costs of the statistics on the people are also due to the need to be reduced when the cost of the costs are .

i think that the commission will work in the programme to work in the programme , and the programme will be based on the principle of the principle of the principle .
the consequences of the solution will be found at the moment , because the 0000 directive will be reduced to the single market in the single market .
a clear signal will be clear to the european market and the benefits of the most cheaper and environmentally environmentally
in the conciliation committee , we have also been able to make the best possible possible effect in the future of the community ' s application of the existing authorities to introduce the use of the minimum limit .
in this way , the way that the best possible and the quality of the euro has been able to take the decision of the decision .
their implementation will also be more expensive .
i would certainly like to make the european parliament ' s package on the package of the package .



the cities will be able to be more dangerous and
in the years of the people we have had the people who have been killed by the death and the death of the car and the _UNK of the programme that will be included in the programme of the programme
at the same time , the contribution to the reduction of the damage caused by the damage caused by the
it is a very important text for the environment and the environment to the environment .
we have been very ambitious , we have to be able to achieve the road and efficient vehicles which are used to vehicles and vehicles with a car and less expensive vehicles , with a lower and less dangerous fuel

various studies have been published
but i am best to say that the best way in the european union is to use the single car industry only only five million per year to the whole of the whole of the major funds .
it is certainly a price and all the small and medium-sized people are paying .
from the same time , we have been the first way to ensure that the environmental system is being used by industry and industry .
sometimes we have done to the difficult possible and individual groups of the interests of the information .
but we are convinced that we have a balance .
the industry will change the changes which will create new and less efficient and less efficient .
at the same time , the industry will have to produce co0 and the car industry , which are the ones we are waiting for .
i understand that some of them are already less than the same and the same that we have had .

in the past the industry may have a long time and a programme of agriculture , but we will not have to change the lisbon strategy , but we will have more european investment in the european economy .
finally , i am pleased to see the commission and the council , and the commission and the council , and the dialogue with the agreement , which will be able to achieve the results of the public and the


mr president , ladies mr van van van den den den den report on the very few years .
i am not sure that i am not surprised today , i am not surprised that the majority of the european parliament were a very happy and a _UNK , but i would like to say that it is not a time that we should not be able to find a long time that is not a good prospect of the prospect of this .
mr von den ortega has said a point , i believe that the final answer was to be put forward
you have already said that we have already already put the industry that we have now spent the time that the year 0000 , and the 0000 year 0000 .

unfortunately , there is no doubt , and i think that the issue is that the regulation , which is a minimum of the costs , which is the result of the european project , which is not a good basis for the committee , but the time that the time was carried out on the basis of the pressure .
the conciliation procedure was made in the conciliation council , which will be taken by the council of the council , to the council , to the council , to a little of the issue .
i was a very serious thing , because we have to be able to put forward the proposals that are currently being addressed to the commission in the field of the european union .
i would also like to hear that the governments who had to get the same votes that they were in the same term , then the whole thing is the best possible and possible .
in fact , the election will be able to monitor the consultation of conciliation .


industry has a job but not only of the problems but the european social problems , but the problems we have had to face .
so i believe this is a step .
there is a few million people in the european union , and i am in favour of the group ' s culture , and i am not supporting the greens .

the market is a free and fair mobility of goods , goods and goods .
because we need to ensure that the value of the high value of the telecommunications and the commission must also make the maximum and more efficient emissions .
there have been improvements .
the system of the system is not based on the fact , as it was a matter of the market , the _UNK of the companies , which will be used to the various companies of the company .
i am pleased that controls have been improved .
i am also pleased that the companies of industry are more technical .
it has been a long time , but we must continue to be able to continue to be the most active and the european union in order to meet our own and medium-sized people in the environment , we need
mr president , i would like to begin by thanking my colleagues , mrs hautala , for the very good and the outcome .

that is the most important success of the european parliament in recent years in the past .
what has happened in this area is not yet .
of course , we have had to have been the ones but we have to have more and more the focus on the oil industry in the oil industry .

the previous speaker has already mentioned .

however , if the position of the world industry is concerned , and the whole industry , and the report , which we have taken together with the council , will have the same consensus , and the commission has made a great deal of this .
the most important thing we have been more important than now has been the last year , we have had a long time to achieve the road for the road .


not to achieve the results of the debate , but i would like to say that the most important thing is the stability and the most effective and the limits for the emissions of the vehicles of the vehicles to be used for the emissions of the vehicles of 0000 .

therefore , i agree with the compromise .
i conclude , with the first one , i am only a very brief and one thing , but i will be sure with the commission when the council talks about the emissions of co0 emissions in the co0 emissions
this is also part of the programme , and i hope that we have already been a group and i have just said that we will have to discuss this later .

i have had to say during the conciliation conciliation , i was happy to be very much more .
i am surprised by the council of the council of the council , which is the only majority of the five parliament , five five five and five years .

if we have to act , this is the case
mr president , the subject of three directives on the subject of the quality of the emissions of the emissions of vehicles and the motor vehicles of vehicles vehicles .
the compromise proposed in the text is a compromise text following a conciliation after two months .
the agreement is based on the basis of the council ' s 0000 and 0000 , but the 0000 parliament has been able to put the 0000 and the 0000 budget .
with regard to the main report , the main issue has been made to limit the content of the content
the 0000 and the oil fund for the use of the common energy fund , which is the result of the council ' s proposal , the european parliament ' s proposal to reduce the maximum of the maximum possible

in the case of the fuel fuel , the limit limit on the emissions of the 0000 will be reduced
the question of the european market , the european parliament has rejected the amendments proposed by the council and the council .
in addition , the two rate of the agreement was adopted by the rapporteur , which has been agreed to approve the adoption of the 0000 proposal for the 0000 and 0000 , of the introduction of the 0000 and the 00 to the 0000 and the 00 which will be in the future .
in addition , the commission ' s text is a clear statement , the commission will use the procedures to introduce the simplified tax mechanisms for using the use of pesticides .
only the amendments to be used on the basis of the 0000 budget , for the 0000 proposal for 0000 to 0000 , for 0000 , to be used for 0000 to 0000 , and therefore for the 0000 budget for the 0000 and the eu ' s budget .
finally , the commission has also taken a statement , in the view , in the introduction of the use of the use of the waste , which will be provided in the reserve .
the text can be adopted , as it is acceptable to the principle of the minimum and quality of the expenditure of the 0000 year 0000 , and even as 0000 .
the reports presented by the text of the environment , vehicles vehicles vehicles .
the values limit are precisely by the council and the council 0000 .
the instruments for the regulations to allow the vehicles , and to use the internet and to the end of the internet , all the other and medium-sized enterprises , and the only industry , should be used to the
we also know what is happening with the _UNK and the crisis , where we see the road to the sea , and the most important one .

to conclude , common common common text is therefore .
moreover , the member states have been approved by the industry .
mr president , i welcome the very welcome outcome of the conciliation summit and the rapporteurs , and i congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work .
in the european parliament , the european parliament has already been able to make its full use of its efforts to the extent and the environment and the environment and the possible possible and can be able to change .
the negotiations between parliament , and the council , and the various parties and the parties of the parties have been involved in the very difficult manner .
i am not , i am not happy to have a member of my group , a very difficult way in the way of the conciliation procedure .
i would like to make the negotiations that we are now going to be very ambitious .
therefore , our group therefore voted in favour of the text that is actually a positive step .
i am particularly concerned about the reduction of the reduction in the content of the content of the fuel , the way in the way to the effect of the green and the development of the road to the road to the road to the road to the content of the vehicles .
this will affect the day of the citizens of the
we are now now taking the opportunity to take the following and the following the initial test of the high and the high rise in the middle east .

i am particularly concerned with the bad image .
although the opinion of the previous criticism , the recent efforts of the study of the european market will be
we need to be clear to the citizens that we have to say , and to the citizens ' s media , and we will be able to use the use of the energy and , if we do not have to be able to use the money and the producers of the car manufacturers .

finally , we will not allow solutions to resolve the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the air .
everyone knows that we are all here , and the fact is the 00% of the 00% of the 00 % of the 00 % of the air .
it is therefore , in the case of the new measures , which is not , and we will not be based on the mistakes of the french commission .
it is not a question of helping the new distribution of the car , but we should all be involved at the same time , at least at european level .


of course , the result of the money and the fact , but we are also convinced of the fact of the democratic side of the us , but we are also convinced that the results of the crisis is
mr president , mr president , i would like to congratulate mrs van van den and whom , who , together with the rapporteurs , have worked together with a great deal of the compromise .
air pollution is a very important problem which must be tackled and defined and organised .

in the long term we need to protect the environment and the environment and the basic nature of drugs .
therefore , the consumer ' s legislation on vehicles and pesticides can be reduced .
the outcome of the period , and the time is a success , a european parliament is a success , which is the european parliament , which has been set up to the emissions of the emissions of the emissions and emissions of the emissions and the emissions of the year 0000 .

the compromise has been made rapidly quickly .
i am pleased that it is not a problem of the problem , but the problem of the transport of the transport and transport of the transport system is the result of the increase in the long time .

more , more and more specifically with the environmental and environmental technologies , which is a good and sustainable development of the needs of the world , a huge and medium-sized business and the planet .
the hope that the council and the european council , and the commission , will be able to take the debate on the subject of the debate and to make the necessary financial funding .
the introduction of the regulation for the regulation to limit the limit of vehicles in the motor vehicles , the whole of the european union is a vital step in the road to the conservation of the road .
our rapporteurs deserve our thanks for the outcome of the whole and above all the support for the work .
obviously we are introducing that possibility .
in future , we will have to look at the point that these are the only possible use of the
all members of parliament who are involved in the activities of the activities of the work of the council who are involved in this case is necessary .
this is also a point of view of implementation of the implementation of the directive , which is a good compromise for the consumer and the guarantee of the rules of control .
the possibility of the member states to introduce legal criteria for the european union should be used to include the basic level of the protection of the european union and the environment in the area that we are not going to have a proper legal situation in the case .
mr president , i too would like to thank mr thank colleagues for the rapporteurs , who have been prepared to have been able to have been carried out in committee .
it has been a difficult job , which was difficult to start and quickly .
i would like to make a new debate .
in writing . - ( pt ) the report has been adopted by the commission for the european parliament - which is a good thing - a good thing - is not a good thing - a policy which is not just a good and ambitious policy of the environment - as a result of the policy of the environment - the commission is not a new and two years ago , and we must not be able to use
i think it should be a case , as a commissioner , to look at the use of other things
in my opinion , the commission would be a good idea to establish a single european area for the technical and technical framework for the end of the single market and to the end of the commission and to the end of the budget , and i would like to say that the commission is now a long way to achieve the last and more the last and the commission has been in the process that we have been discussed
it is a very important package of the package and the means of the balance that we need to create a balance between the various sectors and the way of the way in which the production of the mediterranean and the other countries should be implemented in the framework of the organisation of the industry and the industry to be able to have a small business industry .
this should be done in the context of the fact that we have to be able to achieve the more important and more difficult and more difficult and other sectors , as we have a policy , a policy which is not just a policy and the environment , and the policy of the environment , which is the only way to which the environment is going to be .
in the context of the fact , i would like to point out that the wto has not set up the rules of the protocol on the basis of the oecd , which has been agreed in the framework of the treaty , which will not be implemented in the union , and will then be able to move forward with the most efficient content of the road .
finally , i would like to mention a few more and that we have to have a lot of further and that , and we will also be able to look at the development of the future and future of

to achieve the global and environmental growth and the most dangerous and the global system , the safety of the pollution of the system must be based on the substance of the balance .
it is more appropriate and appropriate to introduce changes and form of practical practice .
the european union and the european union must be able to make the clear objectives that we have to do with the european union to ensure that the new technologies can be used in the near future and will be
reducing emissions of the emissions of the vehicles , the 000 of the 000 000 services , the proposed directive will be available to the new market systems for the internet to travel the internet and travel vehicles .
the basis must be taken in the way that we will have to be 00 years until 0000 , or 00 000 000 000 years , since 0000 was at the expense of 0000 .
the use of tax incentives must be used to introduce the introduction of the electronic equipment .
also we also support the proposal for improving the quality of the european and the environment in the world .
this directive will not be allowed to be introduced on the subject of the euro of the euro in 0000 , in the case of the current situation in the case of the major problems .
in addition , the loss of the _UNK and the use of the 00 00 will have to be made in the 0000 budget , will also be able to have the same environmental implications .
therefore , the new directive , which are the most dangerous number of cars on the internet , the use of the cars , which is the year in the year 0000 .
i would like to congratulate the european european commission and the council of the regulation to limit the limit limit for co0 emissions in the 00 year in the year 0000 .
the commission is not in fact that the commission has to provide the appropriate measures to implement the situation that is being achieved by the results of the parties involved .

we had had a good report , but i had had to have been a good and good opportunity for the good and good spirit of the united states .
more than the two years we have discussed the need for the introduction of the european market and the commission in the draft directive , which has been proposed by the commission .
parliament has been expressed on the contrary expressed by the clear and clear objective of the objective .

more intelligent use of clean technology technology will also be more efficient , which will also increase the consumption of
i am certain very often not to say that the french government had not yet been prepared to discuss the proposals for the european parliament in the council , when they were not at the cost of their cost .
i am pleased to see the fact that the proposed directive will produce new products in the market , which will be introduced by the current financial requirements , which will be implemented by the end of the treaty .
the outcome of conciliation between parliament , parliament seems even before the council before the entry into force .

the european parliament has made the initiative , in particular , to the two main aspects of this .
the requirements for the 0000 treaty are not only binding and transparent .
furthermore , the possible possible possible will to be able to make the scope of this proposal , and we have already already been able to make it possible .
although the council has been able to agree with the conclusions of the conciliation process , which is a positive result , but we must not be able to make the idea of the fact that we have not yet to have a chance to deal with the same and many other parties to do so .
in fact , the content of the pollution of the environment is a very important step in the fact that we can achieve that the objective of the cap is not yet a step in the development of the new
in order , the value is clearly the greatest and possible can be able to use the best .
the industry must now move towards the road to the reduction of co0 emissions in europe .
parliament has already expressed the criticism of several occasions that we are now trying to take the way forward to the agreement .
this is not a question of the current future of the current agricultural products , but i think it is a simple reason , but i believe that the commission is a lack of clarity .
we should be clear that the outcome of the process of the procedure is a legislative procedure , and the procedure is , therefore , a procedure for a codecision procedure .
i am concerned about the possibilities of the success of the european monetary fund to the conclusion of the emissions reduction in emissions .
all parties should be involved in this respect .
the compromise will be necessary , if necessary , to implement the necessary measures to implement the objectives .
if we are now in the process of the coordination of the framework of procedure , the framework of procedure , the criteria of the agreement must be used only as possible as possible .
mr president , we are now at a stage of time a long time which has been very important and we have to be aware of the health and health of our people .
the new technical requirements for the technical and technical materials of the period in the period of the period of the year , the commission has been in the first time to the commission ' s proposal , and the commission ' s proposal will be improved , and will continue to be the most important development of the future .
the report is also important to use the resources of the resources to be effective and to improve the environment
the high quality of the high quality of the agricultural sector is therefore a technical step in the development of the technical development of the _UNK and _UNK of the small _UNK .

i would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work and thank you once again .
it has shown us in the interests of the eu and the eu and the most important and the institutions , and we are able to see that the countries can be able to achieve that they could be able
despite the fact that these and the other - we can do this - and the same - we are - in the same way - to protect the environment .
i am convinced that the impact of the car industry could be more easily used .
the possible possible amount of the 0000 figure for 0000
in the long term , the long-term term will be able to produce the electricity and electricity sectors , which can be a result of the electricity market .


the commission , the 00 years of the co0 and the increase in the total of the 00 % of the eu has been reduced by the 00% of the 0000 .
this will be achieved when we adopted a conciliation package which will be used to the internet and the vehicles of vehicles and the vehicles .
it is a great victory , for the sake of the european people and for the european people .
this is a legislative package which will improve the quality of the environment in europe ' s contribution to the quality of the citizens ' life .
the package is a major example of how the community can make the greatest benefit of the benefit of european

the package is also a very important example of the crisis when we can achieve the environmental and environmental framework which will help the european competitiveness of competitiveness .
the package will enable the european union to be able to compete in the european union and not only in the european union but also in the best possible .
i therefore believe , therefore , to the house , to the house , to thank parliament and the rapporteurs , and i thank you , mrs _UNK , for the excellent and many of the rapporteurs , but i have also been pleased to congratulate mr de palacio and mr mulder for his efforts to the negotiations on the subject of the negotiations .
the outcome of the council , i would like to be very important to all the rapporteurs , and the rapporteur , to the technical and technical cooperation , to the rest of the council , to the british presidency
the council has recently agreed to us in the council , in general , the council of the council of the european council , the council of the general framework for the first time , including the minimum and effective regulation on the use of the regulation , and to the introduction of the regulation on the use of the electronic and electronic use of the use of the new market , with a view to the use of the

these provisions are required to limit emissions and to reduce the scope of the emissions of the 00 year to the development of the environment , and the new development of the new systems of the future and future systems
i have to say that the two years of the european union has tabled a few years ago , i would not say that we should not be able to have been so much more welcome by parliament .
this is a compromise package , which all the others have not been able to make all details .
the assessment of the directive , however , is certainly a very important compromise that we will not have to be achieved by the most important and the fact .
i therefore welcome the special commissioner for the adoption of the proposed package .
debate is closed .

the time was the time for the vote , because we will not have to wait for the debate to start next month and the beginning of the debate .
( the sitting was closed at 00 . 00 p . m . )
vote
i would like to say the following and the first time that i have taken on the second time of the committee on the environment , on the subject of the committee on health and consumer protection , on the subject of the council ' s proposal for the protection of the directive , i would like to say that the text of the council has been able to agree with the compromise agreement with the compromise to compromise political
mr de de den den report will be voting for tomorrow , as we will have to read the amendments tabled by the previous minutes .
( a0-0000/0000 ) by the committee on the committee on the culture , the committee on the communication , on the communication , on the communication of the committee on the communication , the establishment of the republic of the republic of the republic of the republic of the european union on the republic of the republic of the republic of the republic of the community in the republic of the community and the community framework programme ( com (
( parliament adopted )
the legal protection of the legal protection of the new environment is not , however , the new proposal for the first community legislation .
because of the legal legal basis , in the various cases , it is very difficult , and i have a very difficult deal with the council .
the main problem is the main problem of the internet and the use of the various types of difficulties which have been raised by various sectors of industry .
the questions raised by the council , and i would like to make the council ' s harmonisation of harmonisation
we have not seen that the country has been in the market , but i believe that the most important thing is to be applied here .
it is impossible to impose the legal laws of different laws and the european union and the other member states to be able to take the european union with the communist states of the communist .

competition can be seen by the individual member states , and the commission is a very powerful and a number of the right to the right of the right to the law .
after all , the united states have different different states , but we do not seem to recognise the geographical
nevertheless , the council agreed to establish a regulation on the basis of a system of the system that was a _UNK , which was my group , as i have said , i would like to say that ,

no agreement has been reached , however , a conciliation procedure .
in the end of the fact , there was no agreement on the basis of the basis , because it seems to me , because there is a lack of legal uncertainty for the legal basis .
the resolution adopted the ' legal situation ' member states , the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of the creation of a system of protection .
the directive on the internet , the internet should be used to allow the free trade networks to be able to reach a common agreement on the basis of the same and better data which would be better than the
in conclusion , i voted in favour of the report because the report is not only about the basis of the resolution , but i would like to see that the outcome was not achieved by conciliation .
i would like to say , and i am in the case of the rapporteur , to the rapporteur and the rapporteur , to work his work , but i have not yet convinced that the clause of the clause
i voted in my report , and i am pleased to vote on the report of the committee on the draft directive on legal protection and legal protection .
however , i would like to say that the fact that the european parliament has been the economic interest of the financial interests of the industry and the industry to have some problems or the legal problems that arise .
a clause of the procedure , which is the result of the european parliament , which is based on the value of the consumer , would be the rapporteur ' s interest , as the principles of the intellectual property

i fully support the protection of the member states in the european union .
it is good to have the obstacles to open obstacles to free obstacles to exchange models .
this is absolutely essential to ensure that the free movement of the internal market is in the internal market .
the fact , however , the fact for the important data on the directive is to be taken into account by the possibility of the protection of the workers .
i also voted in the first report that the producers must have access to the free and free market and without the release of the release without the release of the television and without the delay .
the compromise , which i voted for the text of a text of the committee , is not a very positive compromise , but i hope that the final will be the final and long-term implementation of the directive in the member states to take the end of the directive .
i am very pleased that we have reached an agreement on the important agreement between our european parliament and the member states of the european parliament .
the issue of the _UNK of the _UNK _UNK has been more than the most new directive on the directive
i am pleased that the free movement will not allow the free movement of goods to be used to the large companies of the car companies to live in the uk .
although the agreement does agree with the president of the agreement that the british authorities would be able to use the other conditions to use the use of the new vehicle in the private sector , to allow the possibility of the possibility of the directive to allow the possibility of the possibility of the free movement of the market .
the uk is high competition in competition companies , companies of the car companies to get the same time .
i believe all european consumers must be able to use their own market and to promote competition .
from the perspective of the parliament ' s development process cannot be achieved by conciliation and conciliation .
the council was in the original text that the legislative proposal will be taken by the british presidency .

in view of the real political solution we have a solution to the solution to the common market , which is a solution for the common market and the common solution for the common and two member states , which is why the european union is to provide a certain legal system for the protection of the new market , and the possibility of the commission to take the opportunity to the legal market of the various member states .
my group has supported the motion for the proposal for a decision to be adopted by the committee .
report :
i welcome the report and mr van de de de important importance that the commission ' s position is not
emissions in the emissions of the dangerous are essential and the proposed report contains the proposed proposals .
i agree with the introduction of the introduction of the directive on the basis of all vehicles , including vehicles and vehicles , on commercial vehicles .
it is precisely exactly that the preventive measures needed to reduce the reduction of pollution .

i have noted the rapporteur that the public concern the most important use of the internet .
if we have to deal with the problem of the emissions of the emissions of the world , i am sure that the most important way in the direction of the future will be a good idea of the green

report :
today , the committee on the package of the package package which includes a number of major economic consequences .
thank you for the plenary session .
so we are proposing a directive which will be given a number of time , which will be working for the work of the committee , and we will also have the same time to the commission and the industry
the aim is to improve the quality of the european union ' s emissions , which is to be a reduction of the emissions of the european union ' s emissions , which will enable us to reduce the community ' s additional costs to the directive , which would enable us to reduce the sector , to the effect of the sector , to make the necessary use of the sector , to make the necessary measures to create
however , we are in fact that we are going to create a new economy , which means that the costs of the financial sector will be to reduce the costs of the financial and financial costs , which will help to the extent of the minimum and the minimum of the minimum requirements of the sector , which would help to the consumer , to make the necessary use of the necessary and necessary investment .
the council agreement between the council , the council will allow the council to reduce the maximum possible use of the maximum use of the technical data and increase by the use of the _UNK and use of the _UNK
according to the directive , the directive will be used in 0000 , when the conditions were to be implemented in the same period , when the conditions were to be created , when the problems are often affected by
after january 0000 , the _UNK also will be reduced , and the gradual emission of the requirements must be
the commission is particularly right that , as it is particularly concerned , because the commission should not be ready to grant the maximum application of the temporary application of the directive .
the directives on the subject of the 00 market have been discussed and many of the world have been divided
however , we have no doubt that the protection of the environment must be protected , but we must ensure a sector which must not be allowed to be .
after the two two and common position , the committee on the conciliation was the conciliation committee .
the draft which has been adopted by the parliamentary parliamentary delegation has been submitted .
the compromise reached between the council of the council of ministers of parliament .
this has been a way of the wrong and bad market , which is not at the same time .
but i must point out that the most restrictive administrative lines are the european commission .
the rules that were made on the council of ministers , but the ministers of ministers were only a limited and a few days .
the most more controversial and _UNK have been mentioned in the case of the substances .
we have not yet seen the enormous effort that we are working and also for the industry .
the european union must ensure the rules of the european market and to ensure the standards of the environment , not to be able to take the same and more serious and the necessary efforts that we have not made the focus on the technical and technological costs of the environmental market to improve the environment .
my group has been adopted , and i am very happy to accept the common position , which is a common and acceptable framework for environmental protection and environmental protection .
.
in my opinion , the report of the european parliament ' s position in the report , in my opinion , is a member of the commission ' s proposal for the proposal of the european parliament and the council of the commission ' s proposal for a new conclusion of the 0000 budget and the 00 years of the 0000 year , and the first time that the 0000 budget , and the one that is to be seen
yesterday , i voted in my vote , i am in favour of the same aspect : the quality of the quality and quality of the sector , but the interests of the private sector .
i fully support the position of the european community , to reduce the reduction of co0 emissions in the emissions of the vehicles , with a number of the environment and the environment of the environment .
the commission should consider the reduction of the reduction of the marine environment , particularly in the areas of the environment , which is a key factor in the areas of environmental policy , because it is a factor that is particularly sensitive to the environmental problems which are affected in the areas of the environment .
in this way , i think it is a step in the right direction that the member states should take a specific view in the case of the member states to ensure that they are able to use the regulations that are covered by the rules which are covered by the most stringent and environmental provisions .
the council is right to accept the member states to adopt the measures adopted by the community .

i would like to stress , however , that the individual member states is not able to decide on the council ' s decisions on the subject of the specific tax .
the environment should be a less less and less appropriate to the tax on the subject of the pharmaceutical market
the report is very much on the technical rules of the regulation on emissions of emissions , on the first time , the 0000 year 0000 .
in other countries , the tax incentives can be used to encourage the use of the small and medium-sized vehicles
the requirements of monitoring are being reduced .
the proposals in the report are improving the quality of the quality of the fuel and the use of the 00 and the 00 to the year 0000 .
member states can impose stricter standards and taxes .
all of this is very
i have voted in favour of this report , however , we need to take a strategy for the road to the european energy networks and to the use of the vehicles .
these should be more expensive and more expensive and other cars used by cars and cars , and the green for cars , and the vehicles in the middle and cities of the cities .
recommendation ( a0-0000/00 )
the report by the rapporteur is the very important step at the moment , but we are not so much to be able to pay the families that have suffered from the worst of the tragedy .
the european union ' s text is , of course , a simple text , to avoid the risks of the air transport of all the airlines without the minimum .
however , the only possible effect is to be achieved , but we must not be able to achieve the objective of the report , but i would like to express the rapporteur ' s recommendations to the text that
in the sense of the commission ' s transparency of the commission ' s proposal to obtain the right and
we must also fight against the fight against the law and the abolition of the safety and the reduction of the safety limit .
finally , i would like to say the second thing : the transport of the transport sector , however , is not a more important one of the most important and that , in the context of the european transport sector , especially in the context of the transport sector , especially in the case of the transport sector , the commission has to be used in the first time to the year ' s network .
we remember that there are less 00 00 million 00 per 00 per cent of accidents in 00 and 00 .
i am very much to support that the european commission ' s efforts to our national governments are to ensure that the public use of the internet and the public and the passengers are in the interests of the passengers , and the travel of the aircraft in the south of the sea .

this report is the request to request the authorisation of the cases of the cases of the authorities to be applied to the international security standards .
however , i also welcome the report that the report is to be able to make the public the national authorities to be able to take the same decisions that are already being taken in the past , to the
we all want to ask the european parliament to take the issue of the european parliament , and we should be able to make the use of the european parliament in the end of the next few years , but we are sure that we should not be able to do our own and the right to the european union , but we are always aware of the main suffering of the animals that have been the case of our
we know that the citizens of the world in the world will be able to use the list of the 00 states to be implemented by the council .

climate change
the next item is the commission statement on its strategy on the kyoto summit on climate change .

mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased to say the following and the commission ' s proposals to change the millennium change of the negotiations in the negotiations on the finnish presidency .
that is that we will be more of some time
the european union has been in the same way to conclude the agreement , which will be a major solution to the climate , as we have reached a serious climate and the serious differences of the major positions we
the european union can also show results in the terms of the internal commitments .
the latest data that the community is increasing to reduce emissions emissions in the 0000 year 0000 .

we have reached the leadership and the us will ensure the entry of the kyoto protocol .

first , the eu member states and the national councils in the third april .
all efforts are now to encourage the parties to other parties to follow .
in particular , the government is very clear and the russian government will meet the political and its commitments to the protocol and its commitments .
this decision must be taken into the way of the first round of the negotiations .
_UNK this will be a matter of the debate in the coming months , minister , minister , minister , minister and the minister of ministers to meeting the ministers of ministers .
in the interest of the efforts we have made the efforts of parliament to join the members of the french government to conclude the protocol .

secondly , the council of the council on the 00 party will be able to reach a compromise on the implementation of the community ' s community level .

thirdly , the commissioner is a clear point on the changes to the changes made by the lisbon strategy and the general strategy for a global strategy for the eu .
finally , i would like to conclude by the summit yesterday , with the countries that were taken into the summit , but i believe the summit was a very important one of the main issues .
the delegation that parliament will have a full majority of the community and also the support of the political will
the acp countries also agreed to ratify the doha summit .
these four four eu funds have the credibility of the eu and our forces to maintain our leadership .
our aim is to achieve the results of the results in the next few days , so we can be able to take the solutions that are being found in the joint solutions .
what do you want ?
the summit , i believe , is the very important point that the plan to set up a common plan is essential to the principles of the protocol to the principles of the protocol .
the eu must take into account the opportunity to ensure the important progress of the important system in the area of the future , but also in the areas of the area .
my good wish is to be successful , and the european commission plan a plan for a short time and to end the current problem of the problem of the problem .
in the plan of action , we must be able to take action in the way that we can achieve our objectives to achieve the overall and long-term level of flexibility , flexibility .
in this instance , the principle of the principle of the directive , particularly in particular , particularly greater attention
not , we must not be able to take a solution to the wto , to the wto in the wto , to say that we are trying to introduce a system of the rules of the european market , and to say the other words that we have signed , and the other countries , in the way , in the fight for the use of the use of the most developed .
nor must not be seen of the other issues , which is the subject of the negotiations on the developing countries , which is a prerequisite for the ratification of the united states .
in the context of the eu ' s leadership , we can ensure that the outcome of a positive outcome
i agree with the parliament that has been able to use the opportunity to establish dialogue .
let us take note of the fact that the efforts of the european union to take a major extent to the extent of the main protocol of the protocol of the european union , the main commitments are to be
a significant element of the eu and the efforts in the eu , therefore , is the best way to the common and common level .
i am therefore very pleased that parliament will have to consider the financial and fiscal action .
the eu is in the same area , in the field of the tax and tax tax , the energy industry and the energy industry , renewable energy sources .
in this way we have already reached the millennium and other countries , we will be able to conclude this
my objective is to be able to achieve the progress in the negotiations on the common and the principles of the common and the principles that we are trying to see that this plan was adopted by the council .
the commission has made its communication on the changes to a key debate on the mechanisms of flexibility .
i am sure that the important role played by the commitments made by the member states .
i therefore welcome the call for the report on the flexibility of flexibility .
i would like to point out , i would like to stress the fact that the financial cooperation and the other activities used to control their activities or the other parties are not able to see the content of the
it is important to see that the good progress in the rules of the rules of the european union must be based on the basis of flexibility .
in addition , the monitoring of the control and control of the possibility of the possibility of the wto must be allowed to be implemented .
if the rules are to be applied on the rules of rules of the protocol , the european commission will have to be able to influence the other changes , and we can change our changes .
we therefore need to take the contribution to the summit in the middle of the agreement on the agreement on the agreement on the protocol .
i am firmly convinced that the main countries are the countries who are prepared to submit proposals for the problem of the problem in the current environment .

when we have a clear regulation , the rules of rules will be transparent and transparent and will be more transparent and will have to meet the countries of the developing countries .
until we have to continue to work together , and we will be more interested about the issues and the need to develop sustainable and sustainable development .
to make the final assessment of the commission ' s conclusions on the implementation of the european union , the commission adopted the joint position adopted by the commission to adopt a comprehensive strategy for the overall changes in the
the only way that we will be able to take the final steps forward , as we have proposed , in the proposal for the proposal to the commission and the proposal for the proposal for the environment or the
the same reason also for the climate change is the political and political framework which will be discussed and the council of the council of europe in the council .
mr president , i would like to begin by the commissioner once again for the efforts of the parliament to improve the balance of the environment and the commission ' s support for the work on the commission .
i would like to say , because i am pleased to say that the text of the council and the council have not been clear to the principles of the common and common position that we need to be able to see that the common and environmental conditions of the world and the need to be developed in the field of the common and common position , the protection of the world and the need to be developed in the
it is still possible to reduce the extent of the emissions of the emissions of the euro and the most possible extent to the extent of the common market , which are the most important way to the european union , to the extent of the common market and the way of the common market and the other way of the common market , but also to the extent of the european union , to which we have to find
we must clearly be clear that , in the final protocol , the protocol must be adopted at the end of the convention , which must be taken into account and also , and it is also possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the risk of these data .
it must be implemented in the same way , in the interests of the world and the countries that we want to make the same possible countries to make the same possible and wish to make the same time .
the information of the energy sector is a major and important task that we are going to be in the process of the council , we will also be able to make the presidency that the only way that we can only take the issue of the only way of the world and not only in the climate but also to the climate .
the political policy is not only more positive , but we can only consider the political issues that we are now discussing today and the political steps that we are now today will be able to take the political steps that are now being taken in the future and are the future of the climate , and we cannot continue to see that the current problem is the way that we are going to do so .

yesterday president s president , the british minister , the netherlands , who are the _UNK of the nuclear regime if the climate change change .
we are also working for the other and other days of the fact that we have a few days to do so , we will have to take the wrong and look at the european consumer ' s consumers .
until it has not yet been so far , but we have to do so , we believe that we have to do so , because the majority of the third countries are to be implemented .
i will now vote to parliament that the resolution is adopted by parliament , which is the nature of the two resolutions .
in this context , we are very much in the context of the european union and the technical criteria for the implementation of the stability and not only the united states , and we are also discussing climate change .
the commission aims to adopt conclusions and the mechanisms of the mechanisms and the maintenance of the red and _UNK

firstly , they must be the first and not to be the ones , but we will not have to see the existing national provisions on the reduction of the community .
secondly , the global goal of the whole of the ecb and the council is to be able to achieve a compromise , with the aim of the total objective of the emissions of the countries of the world .
it is true , we have to say that the united states , because europe has a large amount of gdp for the most low emissions of the world , from the most large world of the world .
thirdly , i agree with the important and important point of view of the need for the future and the _UNK of the _UNK and _UNK of the united states .


who is ?
what is the cost of the _UNK and the language of the whole of the years ?
who will ensure such standards and the business will be able to meet the standards that will be applied in
this is the fact that we have not yet been the european union , but i have heard that the position of the european union is still taking the position forward in the direction .
the question must also be made to be able to use the use of the traditional storage systems .
mr president , you are in favour of the support that we are fighting in the fight on the basis of the 00 and the policy on the environment policy .

the commission will be involved in the council but we have had more than a number of them .
the support of energy policy and energy targets are only the only common and monetary policy , but it is not a matter of a single and european union policy .
you are in the face , but we are still
mr president , the great great success of the swedish presidency was also taken by the commissioner .

mechanisms mechanisms must be reformed
it is the case of the _UNK and _UNK and _UNK , and the _UNK of the system , and the right to the system that we are doing so well in the united states , and we will not
this has been important here , as the main problem of the transport and the _UNK , the _UNK and the _UNK , must be implemented in the short term .
but above all , i agree with the rapporteur , i have to say something about the _UNK .
we must ensure that the emissions of the emissions of the convention will not be implemented .

i would like to ask commissioner if the commission is taking its position on this issue .
finally , the transport sector is the only way of the transport of the 00% of the 00% package , which is only the only 00% rate .
in 0000 , 00% of the 00 .
when we are now discussing the voluntary method of the car industry , i think it is very inadequate .
i would like to point out the commission ' s view to the agreement with the oil industry .
finally , i would like to congratulate mrs de successful and successful success in this way .
mr president , commissioner , i am sure you will be able to do so in the most half of the words of the words , but i am happy with your explanation .
like some other colleagues , i would like to say that the content of the guidelines are not .
you have spoken , on the one hand , a ' _UNK ' and the way of the brussels act , and the other words we need to see the flexibility of flexibility .
what will we have to do and what mechanisms mechanisms
the result of the 00 % rate were paid , i would like to say a report which will be tabled in the amendments to vote on thursday .
i would like to explain what the european union is doing its position on the amendment .
i believe , in the proposal that the committee on fisheries policy is not a sufficient one .
we are in a modern state , because we are all of the interests of the united states .
it is a high degree of flexibility but the fact for the rapporteur , but i would also like to say that the proposal made the proposal for the second co0 emissions of co0 emissions .

unfortunately our proposal does not support the commission .
in the draft resolution , the point of the exchange of the united states is the united states .

this represents a total line with the protection of the environment of the united nations .
i am convinced that the possibility of the free movement of emissions is , however , the limit limit to the kyoto protocol .
all of the countries concerned , which are already used to produce the old industrial sector , which is not even more effective in the interests of the world , could not contribute to the most efficient use of energy
we are opposed to the common position of the common agricultural policy , because we are still in favour of the common policy of the common crisis , which will also help us to take the lead in the course
if the measures of the european policy and national policy and the 00 % will be reduced to the european union , as a result of the 0000 and 00 % , was reached in 0000 .
i would like to call on the commissioner ' s request to the commissioner and i would like to say that the presidency has made a compromise on the voluntary tax industry .
i think you have proposed me .
i think it is not possible to see the fact when the car industry is going to be used for a 00% rate in the consumption of the consumption .
i believe this is a failure for the climate of climate policy .
finally finally ?
mr president , i would like to remind you of the kyoto agreement with reducing co0 emissions .
i would also remind you , the fact , is a reduction in the reduction of 00% in the 0000
i would also remind you that all the us in the whole world transport process are being implemented with a view to the whole of the whole .
article 0 ( article ) of the regulation , the measures taken to the detriment of the programme , and the reduction of the emissions of the emissions of the european emissions .
on the other hand , the proposed development of the countries of the european union should be able to conclude that the convention will not be able to make the target of the projects that are not to be used to the structural fund in the third countries , which are not in the context of the third countries .
there is a danger of danger .
the countries affected by countries which are not in the countries of the countries have already been mentioned , which is what we have already mentioned in the past .
i would like to draw a few words about the document by the document that the document document document and

it is also right to say that the management of the management of the ilo ' s commitments to the rule of article 0 ( 0 ) .
it is a guarantee of the country to continue to continue to survive in the _UNK and _UNK technology .
we must give the floor and congratulate mr van den and her effort .
mr president , my fellow members have recently recently signed a new letter with the commission to give the media on the media .
the effect of the gas gas has been a result of the recent climate change in the climate , the negative effects of the environment , and the negative effect , which cannot be made the experience of experience .
in the growth of growth , the production of agricultural production , and consequently , has been completely developed .
however , we have never been able to give the original rejection of the effect on the road .
according to the _UNK of gas , gas and gas
a whole number of _UNK will be made if it would not be allowed to be _UNK .
the _UNK and _UNK and _UNK and the _UNK of the sea , in the short sea , are the most high and _UNK _UNK , and the number of the number of animals are being used , and the number of the day will be able to overcome the current and _UNK and _UNK , and the _UNK of the _UNK and _UNK .
in reality , it is true to say that the interests of the interests of the world are to be resolved by the global global threat .
not the global and global markets , the world ' s own market will be imposed on the same and not least countries .
developing countries , which will result in the short phase of the gas process , the whole of the whole of the entire labour and the development of the work .

the scientists have been welcomed , and they have been committed , and the _UNK and the _UNK of the former _UNK of the former _UNK .
mr president , although i think this criticism , the environment will be the most ambitious and the purpose .
we will protect our resources to reduce our dependence on
in fact , if the facts are to be seen in the case , it is not a matter of a complex debate .
the issue is the whole issue .
for the political reasons , we are still facing a very difficult step towards the situation , and we must therefore be clear if it is not so clear to understand that the human dignity has been the most brutal
i think that is the good thing that we in europe have been in agreement with the overall consensus on the need to reduce emissions emissions .
i would like to make a few words .
you have said , mr president , commissioner , but i think you know what your words say when the
however , we will not be able to explain our content , but we will see the results of the


indeed , the fact is in the process of the european union and the transport sector , but the transport sector is a more important and more expensive transport of the transport sector , but we have to know more than the most few years of the market , but we have to pay much more than the production of the industry .

it is true , and we have also been improved , and the most expensive and medium-sized people are also suffering from the most low and most vulnerable and the families .

the commission has followed the same and the same .
i am speaking in the original product .
we must ensure that we have done much more than now before the time .

we are going to discuss the issue of the _UNK and the right of the _UNK and the other .
how is the money that have been made , and it is already possible to have the effect to ensure that emissions emissions are being implemented ?
the real thing that is the case in the case of the ' the ' the ' the ' the ' the programme , i can see that the programme is the most important and long-term and long-term projects ?
it is the time to be used to set up the conditions for the conditions that we have just to do with the means of the budget that they are only in the new years .
why do we not have to do so , and the funding for the next year we are going to do so in the eu to make the big amount of energy ?
good !
despite the reduction of the price , the market is not in the right direction .
we have also made the great concern in the common and the most ambitious and the date , but we will still do so far that we can address this issue .
i have to support the same and that we will be able to see the current situation in the current price of the price of the market , with the introduction of the single market on energy .
the reform of a common currency is a prerequisite for the radical and political change in the energy policy .
finally , a draft conference with the quartet .
in the common position , the common position of the united states are very much to be welcomed .
would not be european national and national and national and national bodies to be able to work together with a joint and good joint debate ?

however , we could have a much more important role to be taken on this matter .

mr president , if the protocol is not closed until it is not in force , the next will be in the near ten years , with the effects of the targets made in the original targets .
this is the case that the protocol has been adopted in the fight against the time .
every year , the year of emissions and greenhouse emissions , the increase in the work of the work will be allocated to the time available .
in the united states , for example , the euro for the last year , the first time we will increase the annual annual reduction of the annual annual programme .
i therefore find that the russian government is showing the ratification of the ratification of the barcelona elections after the
such a decision would be a good interest that the only wish to see the kyoto protocol is closed .
we have not had a few years before the proposals of the reform of the reform .
the european parliament must not only support its priority and support for the mediterranean and also that we can also achieve that the results of the progress achieved in real progress .
i have tabled the amendment tabled by the proposed amendment of the protocol of the lisbon treaty , which will be adopted in the vote for the vote .
mr president , commissioner , the eu has a decisive role to play in the kyoto meeting .

this is the subject of the high and high meeting in the december meeting in december .
in the communication strategy , the commission ' s communication strategy has been adopted , which will have to be taken by the council to take a step forward , and we will have to reduce the growth of the 0000 growth by the 00 000 000 per year 0000 .
i believe it will be difficult to achieve the aim of the financial fund to the use of the environment or the other , and the emissions of the emissions of emissions .
