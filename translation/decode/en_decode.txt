Parliament's amendments are not intended to record these fines in the budget, but to transfer them in accordance with the Treaty of Maastricht - using a derogation from the general provisions - to the countries belonging to the euro area.
Finally, many of these amendments relate to the implementation powers of the other institutions.
The Treaty of Amsterdam abolishes the common organisational structure between the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.
The amendment we are tabling seeks to adapt the text to that provision.
We are asking for the Ombudsman to be included among the institutions recognised as having powers of implementation, along with the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee.
We think that is possible and we are proposing that amendment in my report.
Mr President, I would like to stress that the Committee on Budgetary Control unanimously approved four amendments tabled by the group to which I belong, the European People's Party, to make it possible to produce an opinion by the Committee on Budgetary Control, because what happened was this: we made our decision after Mr Dell'Alba's report had been approved by the Committee on Budgets.
I would like to focus Parliament's and the Commission's attention on an amendment we are tabling, which relates to extending the powers of UCLAF to the control of other institutional bodies of the Community as well.
This is an addition to Article 22(2), enabling UCLAF to check the way parts of the budget which relate to other institutional bodies are dealt with, and I would be very grateful if that amendment were to be approved.
The other three amendments concern administrative matters related to certain programmes involving third countries, particularly candidates for membership. They concern the ability of those countries to manage Community funds on their own.
In conclusion, Mr President, I repeat that it is important for these amendments to be passed, especially the one which I told you concerned extending the powers of UCLAF so that it can check other institutional bodies and services of the European Union.
On that point, moreover, I should like to hear the Commissioner's views, in other words whether the Commission accepts those four amendments by the Committee on Budgetary Control
Mr President, what can I add to the words of our rapporteur and draftsmen?
Very little, I believe, and I therefore hope to be brief.
However, I would first like to congratulate them and particularly Mr Dell'Alba who has done some excellent work on a routine yet fundamental issue.
Legislative work is perhaps normally less interesting than own-initiative reports but it is just as, if not more, important.
I have no wish to argue with Mr Sarlis, who used part of his speaking time as draftsman to claim certain amendments for his own political group.
I would, however, like to remind this House that the amendment he highlighted is, in fact, a compromise amendment between the Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Moving straight on to the subject - and if there is any time left, I will look at other questions later - the PSE Group would like to emphasise two points: the updating of the regulation and the Ombudsman.
As Mr Dell'Alba rightly said, we are now faced with updating once again the 1977 Financial Regulation.
This update includes the new elements contained in the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Amsterdam, or at least introduces the regulatory instruments to be used when the latter enters into force.
There is no objection to this; the opposite is, in fact, true.
However, this is the umpteenth update.
No one knows any longer whether it is the seventh, eighth or ninth.
No one really knows.
Indeed, if the new Financial Regulation is to be formally correct, perhaps what we really need is a new Financial Regulation, with a new basis.
The European Union that is preparing to enlarge towards the East is very different from the European Economic Community of the 1970s, when the foundations of this Financial Regulation under debate were laid down.
It was a Community that did not even have a European Parliament elected through universal suffrage, and which was beginning the negotiations on the accession of the southern countries: Greece, Spain and Portugal.
We are very far from that situation.
I therefore believe that the Commission, which has told us so often that it is in favour of drawing up a new Financial Regulation, should give fresh impetus to that idea.
We understand that there are even working documents on this matter. Incidentally, we have not been sent any of these documents but we have, of course, managed to obtain some of them.
These working documents should be forwarded to Parliament and should be debated. In addition, we need to establish a dialogue on this revision of the new Financial Regulation and to do so as soon as possible.
It is absolutely urgent.
The other major political point involves giving appropriate consideration to the Ombudsman.
The European Parliament could certainly lay claim to the creation of this post, since it came about as a result of a parliamentary initiative taken up in Maastricht. However, we believe that the political and institutional body that is the office of the Ombudsman requires the specific treatment afforded it by the amendments to the proposal for a regulation.
The very independence of the Ombudsman demands that it be excluded from the European Parliament's budget.
If the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee are consultative bodies of the Council and are given their own section, why was the Ombudsman going to be included in Parliament's section of the budget?
There is no political logic here.
We therefore support the move to designate it a specific section of its own.
Perhaps half the amendments to the proposal for a regulation relate to this issue.
The remaining amendments, ladies and gentlemen, relate to other aspects of this update with which we are in total agreement: the euro, the payment of fines in connection with the stability and growth pact, the decentralised bodies, and the necessary and logical dissolution of the common organisational structure of the two committees, since it has been clearly demonstrated that the Maastricht 'invention' was not efficient.
We agree with all of this and the amendments reflect what we could call the House's doctrine on the issue.
I am therefore not going to go into detail in that respect.
However, I would like to say once again that we hope that the European Commission will very soon present us with a Financial Regulation already conceived for a Europe that will embrace a great deal more than its current responsibilities.
The Liberal Group also thinks that some important amendments have been proposed here. I want to thank especially Mr Sarlis from the PPE Group for ensuring that the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control were put forward.
As one who is very active in the PHARE area, I am of course very keen to promote amendments concerned with decentralisation, which may facilitate better management of PHARE resources and at the same time help to expedite the process of enlargement to take in the Eastern and Central European countries.
I must say how surprised I am that the Commission has not contributed any input of its own on decentralisation.
We already started this discussion last autumn, when the Commission took a very positive stance on decentralisation, which it said it wanted and was prepared to implement.
The question was also taken up in the Agenda 2000 papers. Even so, the Commission has not taken the opportunity to put forward concrete proposals in this area.
It is odd when people say one thing and do another.
Hence it is for us in the European Parliament to hold the Commission to the things it has promised and the commitments it has stated.
What is important about decentralisation is that it serves to convey a clear political will to help Eastern and Central European countries qualify for EU membership.
It is, so to speak, the precursor to the Structural Funds, and at the same time it provides a means by which the new Member States can put their administrative structures in order, gain some experience and be well prepared for accession to the EU.
In addition these are recommendations which will find favour with the Court of Auditors, because they involve changes which may help us overcome some of the problems currently experienced in the management of the PHARE programme.
I am thus happy to recommend these amendments to my colleagues and hope for their sympathetic support.
They serve to give a clear signal that we want to promote enlargement.
They may pave the way for membership and may ensure that we get a more effective PHARE programme.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes the generally favourable view which the Committee on Budgets suggests you adopt on the proposal for the eighth set of amendments to the Financial Regulation.
This is the last specific amendment proposal before the Financial Regulation is redrafted, on the subject of which, on 22 July, the Commission presented a working document intended to open up a wide-ranging interinstitutional consultation.
Mr Colom I Naval wanted the Commission to present this formally and officially to the European Parliament.
There is no problem, I will do so.
This eighth set of amendments does not seek to substantively modify the Financial Regulation.
The proposal simply seeks to bring the urgent and limited amendments required by the launch of the euro and the stability pact and the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam whose sole effect on the Financial Regulation - given the removal of Protocol No 16 on the common organisational structure of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - is to introduce a specific section for each of these two bodies.
The Commission can undertake to adopt several of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets.
These are Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19 and 20, designed to introduce a specific budget section for the European mediator, and Amendment No 22 which provides a different date for the entry into force of provisions relating to the euro and the stability pact, that is 1 January 1999, and for provisions relating to the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is following ratification.
The Commission is not, however, inclined to adopt certain amendments, which I advise against both for the technical reasons which I will explain and for the essential reason that these are substantive amendments which will make it impossible to respect the tight deadline imposed by the launch of the euro on January 1 next.
In connection with Amendment No 21, contrary to what this suggests, the amount of fines for excessive deficits, as at present the amount of fines for violating the rights of free competition, are not very clear at the time of drawing up the budget.
The budget is not able to include any more than an outline framework.
In connection with Amendments Nos 1, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 15 on the agencies, these have their own budget and financial regulation.
They are not to be covered by the Financial Regulation, which relates solely to the general budget, but rather by the specific regulation which applies to these agencies.
In connection with Amendments Nos 5 and 17 on interinstitutional cooperation, the Commission considers that this cooperation can be organised, as is the case at present for open competitions and purchases, by means of the administrative arrangements between the institutions.
In connection with Amendment No 18 on the Commission's powers of inquiry, this is not a matter for the Financial Regulation but for arrangements between the institutions.
The Commission is not opposed in principle to widening the powers of the UCLAF, but this can be done through an arrangement between the institutions.
As regards the redrafting of the Financial Regulation, the corresponding amendments could, if necessary, be included at the appropriate time.
The question concerning Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 4 by the Committee on Budgetary Control on the decentralised management of PHARE was put by Mrs Kjer Hansen.
During this month of September, the Commission will be adopting an amended proposal for a regulation on the coordination of assistance to candidate countries as part of the preadhesion strategy, in order to permit the decentralised management of PHARE.
This point will also be dealt with at the time of redrafting the Financial Regulation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Draft budget for 1999
The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for 1999.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here today, to inform Parliament of the results of the Council meeting on the budget, which took place on 17 July in Brussels.
Before entering into the details of the successful conclusion of our discussions, however, I should like to highlight the consistently improving level of cooperation between our institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
This was already plain to see last year, and I am very pleased that it seems to be continuing this year.
The two trilogues of 31 March and 23 June were, despite differences of opinion on the substance, characterised by a spirit of mutual understanding for each party's respective views, concerns and priorities.
The same can probably also be said of our discussions at the Council meeting of 17 July, when the main issue was that of legal bases.
We shall be debating this under the next item on the agenda.
I should now like to turn to the draft budget for 1999 and, firstly, describe to you the principles by which the Council was guided in its deliberations.
On agricultural expenditure, we agreed to examine a letter of amendment in the autumn, in order to take account of the decisions of the June 1998 Agriculture Council and the updated estimates of requirements.
We decided to honour the commitments made in Edinburgh to guarantee the future funding of the Structural Funds.
For the remaining policy areas, we established clear priorities for the financial resources available, and set amounts for them in the budget which are realistic and yet do not hinder important Community policies.
We took account of both the criteria in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 29 October 1993 and the Court ruling of 12 May 1998 on the provision of legal bases.
In addition, we took into account minor items of expenditure, and the fact that the financial perspective ceilings leave considerable room for manoeuvre.
We approved a limited increase in all administrative expenditure, and agreed that unavoidable expenditure should not be ruled out from the very outset.
We decided against creating any new posts, apart from those needed in connection with the last enlargement or the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty.
Furthermore, we decided not to create any additional posts in the context of the career policy, either by converting posts or increasing them in number. In so doing, we were of the opinion that the response to practical needs must, as a general rule, be to improve specialist skills, modernise equipment and working methods, and restructure existing posts, and that this principle should only be disregarded where it can be proved that to do so is unavoidable.
Observing the principles we felt underlay the adoption of an appropriate budget led to the following results in practice. In the case of agricultural expenditure - Category 1 in the financial perspective - the Council has retained the total amount proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget.
Similarly, for the Structural Funds, the Council has kept the amounts proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, so as to comply with the Edinburgh decisions.
The Council has decided to reduce both the commitment appropriations and payment appropriations for internal policies.
In the case of external policies, the Council has decided to increase the commitment appropriations and reduce the payment appropriations, so as to take account of the decisions made at Cannes.
Finally, the Council accepted a limited increase of 1 % in overall administrative expenditure.
As I have already stated, the work involved in implementing the Amsterdam Treaty - in particular, incorporating the Schengen secretariat and the analysis, early-warning and policy-planning centre under the second pillar - have made some exceptions to this rule necessary.
For the small bodies, the Council has again applied the method established last year, of granting a flat-rate total amount for routine administrative expenditure.
The effect of the Council's decisions on the appropriations in the draft budget can be summarised as follows: commitment appropriations total EUR 96 500 million, an increase of EUR 5500 million, or 6.05 %, on the 1998 budget; payment appropriations total EUR 85 900 million, an increase of EUR 2300 million, or 2.81 %, on the 1998 budget.
The payment appropriations thus correspond to 1.10 % of Community GNP.
For internal and external policies, there are still margins of EUR 937 million and EUR 878 million respectively beneath the financial perspective ceilings.
Finally, I should like to thank all the members of the European Parliament delegation who actively participated in our discussions at the Budget Council on 17 July.
I look forward to continuing to work in cooperation with this Parliament, and in particular with both the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Samland, and the two rapporteurs for the 1999 budget, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola.
I hope that our two institutions will be able to bring the 1999 budget procedure to a successful conclusion, just as they did for the 1998 budget.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.
Mr President, the draft budget for 1999 resembles the preliminary draft budget closely.
A difference of only 0.5 % confirms that there is a broad convergence of views with regard to the 1999 Community budget.
The Commission and the Council have had to reconcile rigour with the obligations of the Union, in particular with regard to the decisions of the European Councils of Edinburgh and Cannes.
As far as compulsory spending is concerned, the Commission will submit an amending letter at the end of October to take account of the last available information for the finalization of the 1999 budget.
This will be the second application of the procedure successfully established in 1997.
Contrary to last year, however, there may well be spending requirements if current developments on some markets are confirmed.
On structural actions, the draft budget establishes the payment credits at the level proposed by the Commission. This should assure the correct financing of the requirements for 1999 in the light of the Edinburgh decisions.
Category 3, internal policies, is the only category where the Commission proposals have been seriously cut, even below the 1998 level.
This is sometimes difficult to understand as some of these cuts concern Council priorities, notably Leonardo and small and medium-sized enterprises.
These cuts are explained in relation to the reference amounts of regulations but it is not in the spirit of of the common declaration of 1995 to consider these reference amounts as if they were maximum amounts.
Finally, on external policies, for the first time I can remember the draft budget exceeds the preliminary draft budget.
This is logical on the assumption that the requested reinforcement of PHARE in 1998 is not taking place and the Council was to complete the financing of the external cooperation programmes as they were decided by the European Council at Cannes.
It is commendable that the Council provides this financing mainly through additional spending and thus limits the cuts in other important areas of external cooperation.
Above all, the draft Community budget for 1999 is a constructive step in the 1999 budget procedure.
It augurs well not only for next year's budget but also for the more far-reaching decisions which will soon have taken place on the next financial framework.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the Council's presentation of the draft budget after its first reading, I should like to say that the cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission over the conciliation on legal bases, which we will be debating shortly, has been exemplary.
In the first place, in the nine years I have been doing this job, I have never before experienced a conciliation which started at 11 a.m. and finished at 7 or 7.30 p.m. with Parliament cooperating.
Afterwards, they even took it upon themselves to decide the budget as well.
Secondly, they can be proud, not only of a long meeting, but also of the result.
The Austrian Presidency has contributed to this and I wish it just as much skill and success in further deliberations on the budget and on Agenda 2000.
That was the praise - and it is rare coming from me, so make the most of it - but now comes the criticism.
What does this budget tell us?
We have stressed from the outset - and Mrs Dührkop Dührkop will also say this in her report in a moment or two - that this budget is a bridge between the expiring financial perspective, on the one hand, and the new financial perspective, which will begin in the year 2000, on the other. We view it as such.
That is why I should like to make the following general statement on behalf of the Committee on Budgets: we will make every effort to place the 1999 budget procedure in the context of the discussions on Agenda 2000, and the recommendations in Mr Colom I Naval's report relating to the fundamental issue of flexibility.
We want to see progress on these aspects of Agenda 2000, if we are to conform to a budget procedure based on achieving lowest possible expenditure, i.e. on keeping to Member States' average expenditure at Community level.
I am only announcing this here, because it will, of course, have implications for the discussions on the budget in first and second reading in this House.
I should like to make a few comments on the results of the Council's deliberations.
Firstly, on agriculture.
We were a little disappointed that it has not been possible to send out a clear signal on agricultural policy as early as the first reading in the Council.
But we are relying on the fact that we will all take the agreed ad hoc procedure seriously and that on the basis of a Commission letter of amendment we will achieve some results in the conciliation procedure in November.
By results, I mean that we must limit expenditure in this sector and identify procedures to allow these resources to be put to optimal use.
We tabled a proposal for a reserve last year with this in mind, and we will be doing so again.
Indeed, we have already made technical proposals.
I might remind you once again that expenditure on agriculture is ECU 1300 million in excess at present.
Had we not, in the face of bitter resistance from your 15 agriculture colleagues, cancelled ECU 1000 million of spending last year, we would now be ECU 2300 million over budget in the agricultural sector.
The experiences of this year and the last 15 years show, therefore, that we can take this step, and can do so without putting the legal provisions laid down in directives or regulations in the agricultural sector at risk.
Secondly - and this comment is also directed towards the Commission - I am yet again hearing calls from some Member States for export refunds on pigmeat, butter and milk to be increased, to rejuvenate the Russian export market, which is currently in a state of collapse.
Community policy cannot aim to control currency fluctuations outside the Community by raising export refunds.
So do not let them persuade you otherwise, Mr Liikanen, but retain the position you had in 1997; prevail against the six, and take the same line when it comes to securing savings in the agricultural sector for the 1999 budget.
The contents of Categories 2, 3 and 4 are interlinked.
We have already discussed the growth of Category 2 with you many times here in this House.
The reason for this is not that the money is needed, but that this is the last year of the financial perspective; the Structural Funds change on 31 December 1999, and any unutilised appropriations are carried over to this year.
We have absolutely terrific rates of increase here - between 17 % and 18 % in commitment appropriations and around 10 % in payment appropriations.
There is actually an incredible amount of money to be dealt with here.
As a result of this increase, because you did not have the courage to take action on this issue - despite the fact that several Member States, such as France, actually made proposals during discussions in the Council - you are now having to cut Categories 3 and 4 by the same amount by which you have increased Category 2.
You will see, for example, that in Category 3 you have cut funding for the Leonardo programme. That stands in direct contradiction to your own work programme, where you state that you wish to strengthen educational programmes as a means of making Europe more attractive to business.
The EUR 100 million you are cutting there is not going because it has been proved surplus to this programme's requirements - in that case perhaps EUR 86.45 million would have been the sum withdrawn.
No, you are cutting EUR 100 million to make your sums add up, to bring the rates of increase in Category 3 down so that they compensate for the high rates of increase in Category 2.
The second area I wish to address is external policy.
The situation here is far worse.
In Council, you did not secure the adoption of a supplementary and amending budget for 1998, containing an additional ECU 150 million for PHARE.
If we are honest, we have to admit that PHARE will not need the ECU 150 million, either in 1998 or in 1999, because the interim accounts for the 1998 budget year, which were released by the Commission on 30 June 1998, reveal that in the first six months of the year, ECU 1000 million of the appropriations available under PHARE had still not been committed and, even worse, that more than ECU 2500 million had not been awarded and spent in contracts.
That means that there is ECU 2500 million on the table, ECU 1000 million of which is completely free and ECU 1500 million of which might be spent in contracts, if the contracts materialise.
And then we are supposed to increase this by a further ECU 150 million, while at the same time making cutbacks in, for instance, spending on non-governmental organisations.
This has nothing whatsoever to do with sound financial policy, but it does have something to do with ideology.
A decision was made once upon a time in Cannes and now it has to be applied at all costs.
Parliament had no hand in this, and will not, therefore, be accepting either the proposal contained in the Council draft, or the Commission proposal to achieve this through early procedures.
Neither approach is appropriate, and we need to tell the applicant countries, aspiring to become members of the Community, that if together we are not able to commit the appropriations in the time allowed - reminding them once again of the annuality of budget appropriations - then these appropriations cannot be used.
And you will see that this House will not agree to a ECU 150 million top-up in Category 4 at the expense of non-governmental organisations throughout the world.
Finally, there is the question of how research, a very important area, is going to be dealt with.
You are aware, Mr President-inOffice, that in parallel to our 1999 budget negotiations, discussions will be taking place on the total appropriation for the fifth framework programme for research, which accounts for a considerable part of Category 3 expenditure in the budget.
You will also be aware that there is a discrepancy between Parliament's proposal, for ECU 16 300 million over five years, and the Council's position hitherto.
I can hear the voice of your colleague now, announcing that we will certainly reach a compromise on 29 September.
I would be glad if this were so.
It is up to the Council, and certainly not Parliament, to come forward with a compromise formula. And a figure of ECU 14 000 million is not an acceptable compromise; the figure will instead lie between ECU 14 000 million and ECU 16 300 million.
You know that this is an important decision, because it will have a major impact on the 1999 budget - over 60 % of Category 3 appropriations are allocated to research.
If we consider the issue of funding for networks, for example, it is clear that it will be possible to strike a balance between networks, on the one hand, and research, on the other, if the outcome of the agreement on the fifth framework programme for research is known.
That is why I can only repeat my request to you - and your colleagues, the Finance Ministers - to please ensure that sufficient pressure is exerted on your side, so that we reach an agreement on the budget allocation of the fifth framework programme for research for the next five years in good time, before the first reading of the 1999 budget, or at the latest before the second reading.
In the same spirit, may I venture to hope that our further discussions on the 1999 budget are productive, interesting and exciting.
I would also like to add to the praise for the Council presidency for its cooperation, which we believe has been exemplary up until now.
My speech will, in fact, be brief since the chairman of the Committee on Budgets has given a very comprehensive demonstration of the gaps that, in spite of the praise for the presidency, can still be seen in the 1999 draft budget procedure.
However, I would like to highlight several points.
First, I would like to reiterate the fact - as has already been mentioned - that the 1999 budget must represent a bridge. That bridge should not be thought of purely in terms of accounts, but should represent a crucial step forward towards an agreement for Agenda 2000 and the new financial perspectives.
I believe that, as part of that bridge, we have together forged an important element: the agreement we reached on the legal bases.
I would, nevertheless, like to emphasise that it is only one element, and I believe that we should be pleased that we have settled a dispute that had already been going on for many years.
During conciliation, the European Parliament had the chance to set out its political priorities.
I am going to refer here to one category in particular.
The chairman of the Committee on Budgets has already stated exactly what Parliament believes in relation to Category 1 and Category 2.
We do not think that the presidency has initiated an appropriate analysis of the financial resources that would be in the interests of a healthy Community budget.
As for Category 3, I would like to say as rapporteur that Parliament cannot agree with how it reads.
Category 3 is a true scapegoat, to use a common expression.
In this category, to ensure that its accounts are balanced within the 1999 budget, the Council has made cuts in policies that are fundamental for the European Parliament.
I call on the Council - and Mr Samland also mentioned this - to recognise its own lack of consistency.
It is strange that its priorities, as set out in Cardiff, match those of the European Parliament, yet the same Council states with regard to the Leonardo programme that - and I quote the exact English text - ' while bearing in mind the considerable success achieved by these programmes', it is cutting ECU 100 million.
Another interesting move relates to the global package agreed at the beginning of this year on employment policies. The importance of this agreement was highlighted by the Council itself in Luxembourg at its first reading, yet ECU 14 million are being cut from the support for SMEs, despite this being a priority, according to the Council.
Another paragraph from the Cardiff European Council, paragraph 12, states that we are going to pay particular attention to disadvantaged groups, to ethnic minorities and to people with disabilities.
However, at the same time, the Council, as well as the presidency, which had presented these policies to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, are removing these programmes from the budget due to a lack of legal base.
Finally, I would like to say with regard to Category 4 that I fully agree with the approach put forward by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, which has also been set out by Parliament in its guidelines.
We are not going to allow the PHARE programme to be implemented at the expense of other obligations the European Union has towards third countries.
As for Category 5, Mr Ruttenstorfer, I would like to remind you that, apart from the fifth framework programme on research and development, before Parliament's first reading we have another issue that remains to be settled: the question of pensions.
The worker has done his part; now the employer must do his.
I would like to repeat my willingness and Parliament's willingness to cooperate in the future in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion in terms of this bridging budget, bearing in mind, as far as possible, both your and Parliament's priorities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would endorse what the chairman of our committee said about close collaboration with the Council and the Commission in the trilogue and at first reading of the budget for 1999, which was brought forward by the Council this year to 17 July to give us adequate time in view of the tasks and places of work imposed on us by the Treaties.
In this financial statement, the sum earmarked for administration amounts to EUR 4.4 billion, with a total margin of EUR 300 million as compared with 1998.
As last year, the Council has deemed it appropriate to fix an inclusive total amount to be assigned to the other institutions for ordinary operating costs with an increase of 1 % over 1998 levels, with provision, however, for a significant margin to adjust the increase for exceptional and often justifiable cases.
This margin has been interpreted rather generously by the Council for itself, with a rise of 5.14 %, the increase for the Commission being 1.63 %, while for all the other institutions, Parliament included, it was 1.52 %.
In this context, it is worth underlining that our institution is the only one below the 1 % threshold, with a rate of increase of 0.88 %.
As regards staff, the Council has accepted the creation of new posts only if they are connected with enlargement and the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and has rejected the conversions or upgradings requested by the other institutions.
In more detail, the first reading provides for the creation of 109 posts and only 10 conversions, modification of the establishment plans of the institutions by converting some permanent posts into temporary ones, and transfer to the Commission of five posts taken from the other institutions for the medical insurance service.
In fact I am doubtful about two aspects of the staff policy adopted by the Council at first reading, and I will explain these while taking care not to go into the merits of the Council's independent choices.
The first point is that since the Council has seized the opportunity to allow its own staff to increase by 71 to handle the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam and enlargement, it might have been appropriate to establish a common approach to this from the outset, given that this problem is common to so many other institutions, from Parliament itself to the Commission and the Committee of the Regions.
The second point is that frankly it is difficult for me to understand why, if the Council thought it right to award itself 71 new posts, it refused very modest demands from the other institutions, for example the Committee of the Regions, which has undoubtedly seen significant increases in its own responsibilities since the Treaty of Amsterdam.
As regards the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and the consequences of the Treaty of Amsterdam, mention should also be made of the abolition of Protocol 16, that is the common organisational structure which linked the two committees.
I believe that interinstitutional collaboration and avoiding duplication of costs wherever possible - as I have frequently stated - should be the criteria to apply in dealing with all aspects of the division imposed by Amsterdam, so that moving to full reciprocal autonomy for these two committees does not become a cause of dysfunction, jeopardising cooperation and escalating costs.
Turning to the Courts, the 1 % criterion is exceeded for the Court of Justice, resulting in the creation of 10 new posts, but the Council did not accept the Court of Auditors' request for allocations for its building projects, where the Commission has provided for such expenditure in the financial perspective.
Here Parliament must outline the approach required for the most consistent possible attempt to limit expenditure on new buildings in Luxembourg.
Finally, as regards the European Parliament, the Council accepted our preliminary draft estimates in line with the gentlemen's agreement.
By the same token, it also accepted the estimates for the Ombudsman, through a broad interpretation of the agreement which has essentially created a distortion between the criteria for examining the Ombudsman's estimates and those applicable to the other institutions and associated bodies.
In this context, I wish to stress that the Ombudsman is an autonomous institution: our earlier debate on amending the Financial Regulation confirmed that.
This means there must be a specific section in the budget, and it lies outside the percentage of 20 % of the administrative costs which relates only to the European Parliament; it means there should be a dual reading of the budget.
Moreover, the approach taken by the Council does not take account of what has already been decided here about the increase in the Ombudsman's staff.
This decision remains our point of departure for assessing whether a further increase is needed - respecting the procedures always adopted by the budgetary authority and certainly not equal to the increase proposed by the Council at first reading.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great attention to the views expressed by previous speakers and, in my capacity as chairman of the Budget Council, I have also taken note of what has been said.
I can assure you that I will endeavour to bring your suggestions to bear in the Council's further deliberations.
I noted, in particular, that you agree with me that in the case of agriculture we should wait for the letter of amendment.
I also noted that you consider it appropriate to provide a reserve in the agricultural budget.
Obviously, I have also taken note of your misgivings about funds being withdrawn from the Leonardo programme.
It should be said that with the funds allocated for 1999, the Council has actually utilised all of the budget for the whole period.
But I willingly admit that there has indeed been a sharp reduction on the previous year and that Leonardo is a successful programme.
In this context, I can tell you that the Council is currently examining a draft decision to set up a second phase of the Leonardo programme to run from 2000 to 2004, with a considerable increase in funding.
As regards PHARE, the Council recognises the difficulties involved in implementing the PHARE programme and is, like Parliament, keen to see it managed efficiently.
Hence the Council's wish to see a speedy conclusion to the seventh series of amendments to the Financial Regulation, since they contain, in particular, new rules on the utilisation of commitment appropriations, namely that a deadline will be set for the use of these appropriations.
We would expect to see improvements in the PHARE programme as a result.
I have also noted the importance you attach to resolving the research funding issue.
I can only assure you that the Austrian Presidency is making every effort to settle the issue of the fifth framework programme in good time, first and foremost for the sake of research, but of course also in time to draw up the 1999 budget.
Finally, I have noted the calls for a staffing policy not only for the Council, but also in more general terms, and I will try to bring these considerations to bear in further Council discussions.
I should like to conclude by once more highlighting the very good level of cooperation that we have enjoyed with the European Parliament thus far in the budget procedure, and at the same time express the wish that this will be continued in the future.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
Legal bases and implementation of the budget
The next item is the report (A4-0296/98) by Mr Christodoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, Council and Commission on legal bases and implementation of the budget.
Mr President, this is not the first time the issue of legal bases has preoccupied the European Parliament and the European Union's institutions more generally.
If I remember rightly, we have been in a state of relative disagreement since 1981, and now at last, after so many years, we have reached a conclusion for which congratulations are due to all those who have collaborated to achieve it.
Let me remind you that in a resolution we adopted on 12 December 1995, we called for a provisional solution to the issue of legal bases and an end to the impression being conveyed that the European Parliament and the Council, very often with the Commission's intervention too, are constantly at odds over issues about which Europe's citizens are often not very aware, so that they thought we were continually debating in an atmosphere of confrontation.
Fortunately, that has now ended and we can therefore say that we will be able to make normal progress towards establishing a very serious and important procedure, which concerns the European Union's ability to undertake new and pioneering activities that bring it much closer to Europe's people.
Because we must not forget that the Erasmus and Konver programmes, efforts to promote the peace process in Ireland, and so on all started within a framework which we are now trying to adjust by the procedure of legal bases for pilot, preparatory and other similar actions undertaken in the context of the European Union.
We must not underestimate the importance of those actions.
The impression was often given that such activities, which had no legal base and were initiated at an experimental level, were rather exotic, in other words they involved elements of waste, they were unnecessary, and so forth. I do not deny that perhaps some of them could be put into that category, but most by far of those actions were very fundamental and important for the promotion of the European Union's aims.
It is very fortunate that we are now in a position which allows us to establish in law the way in which the matter is to be dealt with, and to settle for conclusions, methods and procedures which will put an end to the constant conflict that has existed between us for so many years.
The agreement as a rule makes the implementation of appropriations entered in the budget for any Community action dependent on prior adoption of a basic act, in other words a legal base, except in the case of actions relating to pilot, preparatory and autonomous actions by the Commission, and appropriations intended for the operation of each institution under its own administrative autonomy.
That possibility is not unlimited, and of course, if it is to be credible and able to hold its own and be implemented correctly, it has limitations with regard to both time and quantity.
And it is very much up to us, ladies and gentlemen, in other words to the European Parliament's committees, through the Commission and then the Council, to promote the establishment of a legal base of that type as soon as possible so that we can achieve two things: firstly, the prompt implementation of really worthwhile programmes and actions and, secondly, the release of resources for pilot, preparatory and other actions from the time and quantity limits to which they are still subject, so that new actions of that type can be included without those appropriations being permanently committed for a very long time, as used to happen in the past.
In other words, this new agreement imposes on us a sense of absolute responsibility, and that is very important for us and we should respond in the best possible way.
Mr President, I would like to add something to what I said earlier about the basic value for the European Union's aims of all the initiatives being undertaken and which, I repeat, result in programmes which are worthwhile and bring the European Union closer to its real aims and to Europe's citizens.
I want to remind us that probably, in the future when this agreement becomes absolutely permanent, in other words when practical application has demonstrated that it is essential and that it operates correctly - which depends on us - that will be the time to consider adapting it.
In other words, if the future shows that there is a need for this agreement to be modified, for instance by adapting the appropriations and perhaps the time limits so as to enable the European Union to do its job more effectively in the very important areas which these initiatives deal with, I am sure that since the system has worked well, everyone will agree to adopt any decisions which will make those actions even more effective.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our views on the issue of legal bases have diverged for many years.
Following the judgment handed down by the Court of Justice on 12 May this year, however, a solution had to be found as a matter of urgency, all the more so because the Commission was deferring the implementation of a large number of budget lines which did not have a legal basis.
At the trilogue of 23 June, new impetus was given, making it possible to bring the parties' positions closer together.
The institutions remained in close contact up until the meeting of the Budget Council, where the majority of the discussions were devoted to this important matter.
All these efforts - and not least your own delegation's perseverance - led to a draft interinstitutional agreement being concluded on 17 July, which should be signed shortly.
This open-ended agreement will make it possible for appropriations under budget lines which do not have a legal basis to be utilised in a way which is satisfactory to the three institutions involved.
The agreement establishes a framework for our institutions to work together in a spirit of mutual trust, something which the Court of Justice has consistently called for in cases of this kind, and which, in my opinion, should be regarded increasingly as common practice.
On 17 July, the Council also took note of the work the Commission had done - in connection with the aforementioned Court judgment - to analyse the status of the budget lines which, though entered in the 1998 budget, clearly lacked a legal basis.
The Council further agreed that the Commission might, by virtue of its powers under Article 205 of the Treaty, immediately implement a series of measures, including some of recognised political sensitivity, such as the following: measures for combating violence against children, young people and women; measures to prevent illegal and harmful content on the Internet; support for, and supervision of, electoral processes; and measures in the field of human rights and democracy.
For those budget lines for which a legal basis has been proposed but not yet adopted, Parliament and the Council have undertaken to speed up ongoing legislative procedures, so that a decision on a basic instrument can be taken soon.
I can assure you that this presidency has already taken the necessary steps to bring these procedures to a speedy and successful conclusion.
As for the budget lines for which a legal basis has neither been adopted nor even proposed, the Council has taken note of the Commission's undertaking to honour commitments entered into before 10 June 1998, and to examine applications which have not yet led to the formal conclusion of a contract. This is being done in an effort to avoid any discrimination which might result from dossiers having to be dealt with by particular deadlines.
On the basis of this procedure, we should assume that funding will have to be guaranteed, since the selection procedures were completed and the beneficiaries formally identified before 10 June 1998.
Finally, as far as combating exclusion is concerned, the Council believes that the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty will make it possible for the necessary legal bases to be adopted.
I should like to thank Parliament, but also the Commission, for its cooperation in this matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.
Mr President, in Mr Christodoulou's report - in the explanatory statement - there is a wonderful line that says this 'provides a long-term solution, since it has not been unilaterally denounced by any of the three institutions concerned' - yet.
'Yet' is my word, because Parliament has not yet voted on this report.
I am going to speak with two tongues in this debate: one - as an individual who has been involved in the debate in the negotiations, and then, as it is my responsibility to speak, in my role as coordinator for the Socialist Group.
On a personal level I welcome the report.
I think it is the best that we could achieve, and a culmination of many years of work and attempts by Parliament to get this problem resolved.
So, knowing what we have gone through in the past, I am extremely pleased with what we have got for the future.
I also have to say that when we were coming to this conclusion on 17 July, there was cooperation between ourselves, the Commission and, dare I say, the majority of the Council.
The previous presidency had given its commitment to resolving the matter.
As the British Prime Minister said from where the President-in-Office now sits, the Austrian Presidency has been committed to it, but I have to say that the length of time taken, which the chairman, Mr Samland, referred to, was because of indecision by at least one Nordic Member State.
Quite frankly, it was a pathetic performance on that trialogue to get a conclusion to this decision, which really involved a small amount of money.
I hope I never have to go through that again because it was a waste of time if nothing else.
That is my personal view.
When we were coming to these conclusions, all three institutions were of a mind that the deal on the legal basis would be fine for the future, but we still have the problem of this year 1998.
That is why I advised caution at the beginning of my remarks.
I, and Mr Samland, Mr Colom i Naval, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Tomlinson - those who were involved in the negotiations - have to convince our group tonight, when we discuss the issue, that this report is worthy of a yes vote.
We need some clarification, certainly from the Commission, on those lines which were considered to be problematic.
There were four areas.
Last night I received a document chart showing the lines where the problems were, and hopefully the Commission has come forward with solutions.
This will be taken to our group tonight and we will do our best to convince.
But I seek the help of the Commission now to clarify those areas of doubt which will arise when Members see this, especially over lines B5-321 - action for the economic and social areas like cooperative mutuals, etc, - where a large proportion of the money has not yet been utilised and there does not seem to be a way of utilising it.
On lines B7-611, 851 and 852, where sums in the region of ECU 11.5 million remain unused, what will happen to those amounts of money?
In the areas which we did have problems with such as sport and minority languages, the bulk of the money has been used.
There will be small amounts left and it is fair to say that even without the problems we have had we could still have had those small amounts of money left.
I am therefore quite prepared to argue the case for them.
But there are those few lines which still give us concern, and I would seek help from the Commission to give us an assurance that those areas will not be left untouched - that the money will be utilised.
With that information I hope we can go forward to our group tonight and then vote positively.
One final point - we went to a lot of trouble to get this report put together and there was consensus on its content.
There are some amendments put forward - three or four by the Greens - which, while nice, are not necessary.
My recommendation to our group would be that we do not support the amendments but we stick by the report unamended.
I do not want anyone to assume that we do not sympathise with the contents of those amendments by the Greens, but we really want the report to be concise rather than elaborate.
Mr President, I should like to express the hope that we have found an eternal solution to an eternal problem, and that none of the three institutions will unravel the agreement which has been negotiated.
In resolving the legal bases issue, I believe that Parliament has proved - at least in recent years - through its work on the budget that it is not only consistent in terms of its political commitments, but also in terms of the way in which it funds these political objectives.
I should certainly like to congratulate the Austrian Presidency, therefore, on the skilful way in which it conducted the negotiations on 17 July. Like Mr Wynn, however, I was present at the discussions, and at times I had the impression that there was no political objective at stake there, but that these were petty negotiations reminiscent of the bourgeois, about a couple of million ecus or so, and the next six months or year or so.
In parts it was indeed embarrassing, and one could not help thinking that at least some of those present were not concerned with finding a political solution, but more of an administrative, technical one.
I am inclined to believe, Mr President-in-Office, that you should not be given all the credit; the time was, quite simply, ripe.
Parliament kept stepping up the pressure, and in the end the Council either had to, or wanted to, give in.
Admittedly, both you and we in Parliament can be happy with the result.
There is certainly no doubt about that.
We - all three partners - now know where we stand for the future and, as Mr Wynn said, we still need to convince our colleagues in the House.
Under current circumstances, however, that should not be too difficult.
As rapporteur for the 1998 budget, I thought it was particularly important that on 17 July - to comply with the Court of Justice judgment - the Commission also tabled a proposal for the 1998 budget, a workable proposal in our view.
As a Parliament, we have also indicated - and in fact this is another significant agreement - that we are prepared to comply with the Court of Justice judgment, and that we are not able to increase the political pressure in this matter.
But some services seem to be taking advantage of the present unclear situation for their own ends.
Commissioner Liikanen, I would ask you to make it clear to all your services once again that, now that a solution has been found and agreed, they should apply it for 1998 as well.
This is because we need the 1998 appropriations to be implemented as soon as possible, so that the NGOs affected receive the money they were promised.
Once again, I should like to warmly congratulate Mr Christodoulou, who is, of course, an old hand, and has worked on this issue for several years.
In Germany, we say that we sit problems out.
We have someone sitting at the head of the government there who sits problems out.
Mr Christodoulou has also sat this problem out and has succeeded!
(Applause)
Mr President, in a way one might say this issue represents much ado about nothing.
In financial terms, it is 60 million for pilot projects and 30 million for preparatory actions - less than 1 %.
The political issue, of course, is much more important: it is a sign that the relationship between Parliament and the Council has finally matured and a recognition that Parliament and the Commission, as Mr Christodoulou rightly mentioned, are putting forward initiatives.
Unfortunately - with all due respect - the Council has become an impotent body.
It can do nothing if it is not put under external pressure.
It was external pressure, via your decision, Mr President, to block a couple of hundred budget lines which finally made the Council aware that it could no longer delay this issue.
This is part of the budget debate in general and we are only talking about a few hundred million here and there.
But the political significance is that the Council and Parliament are finally regarding each other as equals.
That is the final element of this institutional agreement and it confirms the fact that both the Council and the Commission recognise that Parliament has taken useful initiatives which, as Mr Christodoulou rightly said, bring Europe closer to its citizens.
I have one specific question to the Commission, a question which I put two months ago in the debate in the plenary.
If this institutional agreement is going to work in future, a lot will depend on the political imagination of the Commission.
Now that we are close to a result, can the Commissioner confirm that the Commission will always try in the future to propose a legal basis which is as useful as possible, to ensure that the codecision of Parliament is guaranteed?
Can it say that it will only use Article 235 in exceptional cases, because that article is a negation of parliamentary democracy?
I cannot believe that the Commission - and especially this Commissioner, who is very much a democrat at heart - will ever use Article 235 to emasculate the powers of Parliament vis-à-vis the Council.
Mr President, the legal dogmatism of the Court of Justice resulted in the Commission blocking a hundred budget lines for a total amount of more than ECU 900 million.
This has led to the abandoning of many projects run by associations and NGOs in such sensitive areas as combating poverty and exclusion, development aid, the fight against racism, democracy and human rights.
The widespread mobilisation of the associations and NGOs, which our group brought to the attention of Parliament, made a considerable contribution to the interinstitutional agreement of 17 July which resolves the issue of the legal bases.
I welcome this agreement which, moreover, is of immediate application.
I regret, however, that projects for the benefit of elderly people and certain measures to combat poverty remain blocked, and would like to repeat the request already made so many times to the Council for it to adopt a new programme to combat poverty, in cooperation with humanitarian organisations.
The argument has been put to me in this House that, as the fight against poverty is a continuing one, it is not useful to grant appropriations in this field.
I find this argument unacceptable and invalid, as many associations are selflessly engaged in fighting this scourge.
I believe that this position should be reviewed and a new plan proposed in the fight against poverty.
To conclude, I would point out that the involvement of citizens in European mechanisms makes it possible to overcome obstacles and to arrive at solutions and that Parliament plays its role to the full when it sets aside specialist discussions and becomes the vehicle for the intervention and aspirations of our citizens.
Mr President, I too should like to endorse previous speakers' words of thanks.
I believe that this is a good agreement both for Mr Christodoulou and this House, and for the Commission and the Council.
Above all, I am pleased that Parliament was steadfast in its efforts to have the judgment of the Court of Justice recognised.
We were under extreme pressure from some non-governmental organisations to act as if this judgement did not exist.
I believe that the negotiations we had with the NGOs - the outside world in this case - on safeguarding the judgment contributed greatly to raising awareness of how we manage our money, and the fact that we do need legal bases for this.
All in all, I consider this to have been a success.
It still remains to be seen how far the agreement on legal bases will take us.
We in Parliament must now establish legal bases with the Council, and this makes us dependent, completely and utterly - as the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties intend - on the Commission's right of initiative.
That is why, Commissioner and Mr Christodoulou, I have tabled amendments pointing out that this interinstitutional agreement vests the Commission, as the initiator of legislation, with a huge responsibility, and that in the future this will force us to seek maximum powers of codecision for the Council and Parliament.
I look forward to working in cooperation with the Commission on this matter.
But let me now return to concerns related to the 1998 budget, which is quite rightly not covered by the future arrangements in the agreement, but does form part of the overall compromise. Both before, but mainly after, the summer recess, I received a substantial number of telephone calls from people saying that their money had not arrived, even though the appropriations had been released.
In addition, there is still uncertainty about some areas, for example in my case about line B3-1000 and the European Youth Parliament.
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you could give us some reassurance today that everything in your power is being done, and that by this evening, when we discuss this with our groups, we will, as Mr Wynn requested, have precise information about the parts of the budget which you do not envisage implementing, because the judgment simply makes it impossible to do so.
I believe that we need this clarity to be able to vote in favour of the agreement.
Mr President, as the longest-serving Member of this Parliament I remember a time when even before direct elections Commissioners assured us, and through us the citizens of Europe, that the Community institutions had a human face.
That will not be the case if these budget lines are blocked - it is as simple as that.
Think of it: the Foundation for Human Rights closed, NGO funding, abuse of children, the supervision of election procedures and the protection of minority languages, a subject dear to the heart of myself and John Hume who founded the budget line.
I am embarrassed to belong to a state that put this to the Court and caused it to happen.
I am amazed when Mr Wynn talks about speaking with two tongues.
Indeed, that is what he has done, because I was looking to a new government in Britain to change this and it has not!
It seems to be a government of much the same colour and speaking with two tongues.
There are over 30 minority languages that are a precious part of our common heritage, with their own literatures.
We have two in Scotland.
Blocking this is not going to give this Community a human face.
Mr President, I always like it when Terry Wynn speaks in tongues but I do not think it is Pentecost yet.
Mr President, I think we still have some difficulties with this first part.
Firstly the question of the legal basis.
I agree with all those speakers who say that this is really an attack on the people's Europe.
There is no way the taxpayer is going to understand that a further 150 million guilders are being earmarked for PHARE, money which cannot be spent, whilst at the same time here we are rabbiting on about a few million in relation to the legal basis.
Mr President, I think we have to accept this agreement now, although I have serious doubts as to whether we can implement it easily, since the sums it contains are smaller than those which Parliament thinks are necessary.
We shall have to see how that can be resolved.
We have to take a decision on the matter and we must not make too much it one way or another.
We must simply share the damage out fairly.
The problem, as I see it, is this.
As it happens, you are one of the leading lawyers in this House, but the fact is that the Treaty did not allow for this whole problem of legal bases.
The legal basis crept in via the Financial Regulation and the Council's efforts to blackmail Parliament.
That is how it entered the equation.
The lawyers then set to and in effect made a real dog's breakfast of it.
The matter could have been resolved in other ways which would have been perfectly acceptable from a legal point of view.
We now find ourselves in problematic situations of having to give a legal basis, on which in fact only the Council can rule, when we as Parliament have full budgetary powers, at any rate as regards non-compulsory expenditure.
That is an unacceptable state of affairs but we have to live with it for the sake of the people's Europe, in order to salvage something at least.
I accept this with a heavy heart, both as an MEP and a lawyer.
Mr President, the confidence our citizens have in the European Union ultimately depends on how well the EU can address the real, everyday problems people have.
Unfortunately, this trust has never been great.
The decision of the Court of Justice last spring, which was followed by the Commission's decision to freeze funds, caused this trust to slump even further.
While a legal base makes it possible to pour millions of ecus into the EMU campaign, funds for the national organisations were frozen.
Our citizens cannot understand why a legal base allows money to be spent on campaigns such as this, but does not make it possible to spend money on national organisations, the prevention of poverty, on organisations for the disabled, or for example on the promotion of minority languages, which is a very important issue.
I think it is extremely important that an interinstitutional agreement is realised soon.
I also hope that Council will listen to Parliament this time more closely than it has done hitherto.
Unfortunately, the situation has often been that it has been easier for Parliament to get agreement with the Commission than with the Council on matters that have to be dealt with.
Hopefully the Austrian Presidency will now find a solution to this difficult problem.
Mr President, I too should like to echo those who have complimented Mr Christodoulou on his report. He has, I believe, addressed one of the most complex issues we have had to deal with for a long time, and one which is very difficult to explain to the outside world.
This is something we have also felt during discussions in committee.
I would just like to comment briefly on some of the agreement's implications, which I would ask the Council and the Commission not to overlook, as they could affect our work in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, in particular our work in the field of democracy and human rights, but also our relations with Asia and Latin America.
Democracy and human rights - already referred to this morning - are, more than anything else, of central importance to the Commission's future policies - and I am addressing the Commission directly here - precisely because this is an area where the European Union really does come into direct contact with people.
Through NGOs, it deploys citizens from a wide variety of fields, on the one hand, as it were, to work for the EU and, on the other, to help those in need, or - and this is at least as important - to raise awareness of democracy and the rule of law throughout the world.
We hope that the legal bases established will be clear enough for these programmes to continue, and when they do - this is my request of the Commission, Mr Liikanen - there should be less bureaucracy, and hence lower administrative costs; more expertise on some individual issues; and perhaps also less cost to the EU - in short, there should be greater transparency.
We support the Committee on Budgets' non-selective approach in this matter, but we would like to ask you not to disregard these problems.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that you welcome this agreement.
I should like to make one remark, however, in response to some of the opinions you have expressed.
I do not agree that the Council can only come to decisions - and in this case did come to a decision - when it is under pressure.
I really must refute this; I can tell you that the judgment of the Court of Justice put the Council in a very good position, and that the judgment was not the reason for the Council making a particular effort to resolve this issue very quickly together with Parliament and the Commission.
We felt compelled to do this for two quite different reasons.
The first was raised by many of you, namely the fact that this decision was important to many people in Europe, because the implementation of budget lines was at stake.
That is why it was a matter of concern for the Council to find a solution.
The second reason is that this has already remained an open question between Parliament, the Council and the Commission for around 15 years, and has hindered cooperation between the institutions.
It was also for these reasons, I believe, that it was high time to find a solution.
That is why I am very glad that one has been found, and I hope it will meet with your definitive agreement.
Mr President, the draft agreement on legal bases which the institutions reached on 17 July 1998 is a remarkable achievement, and not merely because it is the first agreement since the 1982 Joint Declaration, which turned out to be unworkable.
This is not because large sums of money are involved - those Members who mentioned this point were quite right.
The amounts concerned have always been a small proportion of the Community budget.
It is remarkable because progress has for once been made across the minefield of institutional competences.
The agreement strengthens interinstitutional confidence at the outset of the negotiations for the next interinstitutional agreement.
I must also congratulate the Austrian presidency for the great efforts it made on this issue.
At the same time, in this context, it is greatly to be welcomed that the British Government has decided to withdraw all pending court cases against the implementation of the Community budget.
The winners from the agreement are not only the institutions but, above all, the programmes and the hundreds of organizations concerned.
We have seen a particularly active period of non-governmental pressure groups around the Commission and the institutions.That clearly showed the importance of the actions concerned.
In the future these organisations can be sure that once an amount is entered in the budget the implementation of the budget line will not be challenged.
Some of the actions have to be redefined and not all may be continued for ever.
Such decisions in the future will be taken on the basis of clear budgetary and legislative procedures.
Our partners will be able to rely on the outcome.
The Commission is ready to sign the agreement.
The list of specific powers of the Commission annexed to the agreement is correct.
It can always be augmented in future preliminary draft budgets.
I want to emphasise this.
The autonomy of the Commission is not affected by the agreement.
As far as the budget for 1999 is concerned, the preliminary draft budget is compatible with the agreed ceilings.
With regard to the 1998 budget, the remaining budget lines have been unblocked over the last few weeks.
We have given you information on these particular budget lines.
An ad hoc agreement on 17 July permitted in addition an immediate re-opening of several particularly sensitive budget lines, e.g. the fight against violence towards women and children, actions against illegal content on the Internet and actions for human rights and democracy.
The conclusion of the legislative procedures for a voluntary youth service and for NGOs in third countries has cleared the way for the implementation of these programmes.
Adoption of further legal bases appear imminent.
With regard to the budget lines to combat social exclusion, which were at the heart of the conflict, the Commission is dealing with this issue at its meeting tomorrow.
It will decide on a communication which proposes to re-orient the lines towards preparatory actions for programmes on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty.
With this re-orientation, which I hope will be decided tomorrow, they can be re-launched immediately.
If, after all this, an action remains blocked or partially blocked, the Commission will fully respect legitimate expectations and will also protect existing investments.
The indications from its services are that out of ECU 870m originally blocked for lack of a legal basis, only some ECU 30m may not be implemented by the end of the year for that reason.
Obviously some problems remain in the transition to the new regime. Some are inevitable, as the ruling of the Court prevents the Commission from pretending that nothing has happened.
But joint efforts have succeeded in limiting the problems to the minimum, and from next year the implementation of the budget will be on firm ground.
I will now reply to the questions put by honourable Members. Mr Wynn and Mrs Müller asked about budget line B-5321 on the social economy.
There is no current legal basis, but we are now considering the possibility of a transfer of these funds to budget line B-5512 (employment initiative) which makes possible a similar type of action.
Mr Wynn's other two questions are not connected with budget lines B 7851 and B 7852.
It is very easy to understand for someone who does not follow the budget.
Anyhow, these proposals for legal bases are with the Council, and I hope the presidency will make a major effort to accelerate the procedure, especially for the budget line concerning export promotion and Japan, which has turned out to be very useful.
Thirdly, in reply to Mr Tillich, our services must work on the basis of the decisions which have been taken.
I would say to honourable Members who have been contacted by organisations, etc; please get in touch directly with the services concerned.
That is the best way to guarantee rapid action.
The basic framework concerning the Commission has now been solved.
I have good news for Mrs Ewing on the matter of minority languages and she can have some warm words for the Commission.
Today we have been able to implement the budget line for minority languages practically in full.
A sum of ECU 400 000 is still in the reserve thanks to the European Parliament.
I am ready to propose that the Commission should very soon transfer it and if Mrs Ewing can convince her colleagues in Parliament to accept that transfer the problem will no longer be there.
I would conclude by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Christodoulou, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Samland, and the President-in-Office, Mr Ruttenstorfer, for the extraordinary efforts they have made to achieve this historic agreement.
Motor vehicle emissions - Quality of petrol and diesel fuels
Thank you for that piece of good news, Mr Lange.
Mr President, I can confirm everything the other rapporteur, Mr Lange, has just said.
The conciliation was very constructive, and to some extent we even enjoyed it.
Now and then I, at least, could not help identifying with our opposing side, that is to say the Council.
So I can confirm that we worked in real partnership and both sides argued in favour of the proposals, and the discussion was at times at an intelligently high level.
I would sincerely like to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation and the spirit in which they worked to make it possible to carry forward this proposal in Parliament.
Its basis was the fact that the Commission two years ago proposed binding conditions for the quality of fuels only for the year 2000.
Parliament has improved on the Commission's original proposals quite considerably in cooperation with the Council.
We wanted binding conditions for quality for the year 2005 too, so that the consumer would be reassured that the air would really become cleaner, and so that industry would be able to invest with confidence.
In the end we got the proposal through.
The Conciliation Committee pushed through the proposal for binding conditions for fuel quality for the year 2005 as well.
We think this is very important because this really means that industry can concentrate on producing cleaner industrial technology.
This is vital for the car industry, as the car industry needs cleaner fuels to be able to keep up with the ever more stringent calls for cleaner exhaust emissions, but it is also important for the oil industry.
The legislative authority has now said what is expected of the oil industry by the year 2005.
At times we had the distinct impression during the process that the oil industry wished to blame Parliament for the structural problems there might consequently be in this sector of industry.
But we succeeded in showing that in fact it was high time the oil industry was also called upon to invest in cleaner technologies.
If there was overcapacity, at least more stringent environmental demands could not be blamed for everything.
During the conciliation process, we also managed to change the Commission's approach to the Auto-Oil programme.
Originally, we thought we would be starting with a very narrow cost-effectiveness analysis, but Parliament and various other national players brought other economic arguments to the discussion.
We were also able to show that costs sustained out of human illness have to be taken into account in the figures.
In this way we were widening the whole approach, as it were.
We believe that if the Auto-Oil programme continues in the Commission, the approach will now be crucially different from what it was at the outset.
The effects of this decision will be visible very early on, because cleaner fuels will be coming onto the market by the beginning of the year 2000.
This is a very clear signal to the market that these cleaner fuels are actually being awaited.
During the conciliation process, we also established that the Commission should in future turn its attention more positively to the question of tax incentives, which Member States will possibly wish to employ to encourage the use of cleaner fuels.
In this way, we hope that the quality of the air will start to improve very soon after this decision has come into force.
It will also obviously affect older vehicles.
I would strongly urge the European Parliament to approve this fuels package.
Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs and the other people who have been involved in the conciliation.
They have produced an excellent result which I hope will have the full support of Parliament today.
The proposal will ensure that this programme will make all European towns and cities better places to live and work and healthier places to bring up our children and go about our daily lives.
Towns from Aberdeen to Athens will be cleaner and healthier places to live.
In ten years' time there will be fewer people - children and older people - suffering from asthma caused by car fumes if the targets of this Auto-Oil programme are met.
At the same time, we are going to see a significant contribution made to reducing the damage caused to crops by pollution.
This is indeed a very useful package protecting the environment and public health.
We were very ambitious right from the beginning, wanting to be sure that the motor companies made cleaner, more efficient engines and obliging the oil companies to make cleaner petrol and diesel, whilst at the same time getting rid of leaded fuel.
This proposal has many beneficial effects and, although concern has been expressed about the cost, it is not great.
We have seen various studies.
But we can best explain it if we say that for the average motorist driving the average car in Europe it will cost only Ecu 5 to Ecu 8 more every year to realise the full benefits of this package.
Surely that is a price every motorist - and we are all motorists - believes is worth paying.
From the very beginning we have been determined to ensure that the burden is fairly divided between the oil industry and the car industry.
That has been difficult to determine at times, with all the different lobbying and conflicting information.
But I am now convinced that we have reached an equitable balance.
The car industry will have to change; it will have to bring in new models that are more efficient, cleaner and burn less fuel.
At the same time, the oil industry will produce cleaner fuels; indeed some of them are waiting for the deadlines.
I understand some of them are already putting cleaner fuels on the market now that comply with the specification we have demanded.
It is quite clear they are able to do that.
There may be restructuring in the oil industry in the next few years, but that will take place not as a consequence of the AutoOil programme but as a consequence of more general changes in the European economy.
Finally, this is an excellent example of how, when the Council, the Commission and Parliament all work together and reach a consensus through conciliation we can make a serious legislative impact that affects the lives of all the people of Europe.
We should be proud that we have managed to achieve this in this package.
I would urge all of my colleagues to support it.
Mr President. I should like to congratulate Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala on their reports.
I am not at all surprised to see so many Members jumping for joy today, but I do not wish to mark my agreement in such unqualified terms, because from an institutional point of view, I do not believe that this procedure was such a breakthrough.
Mr Bowe has just given me a cue, which means that I will have to restructure my whole speech.
You just said that the oil industry has announced today that it has had the fuels we are demanding for the years 2000 and 2005 for a long time.
This is the whole point.
Unfortunately, people forget all too often that, if a car is to produce clean exhaust emissions, it has to run on high-quality fuel. That is exactly what we did not manage to achieve in the Conciliation Committee, because the committee was under pressure of time.
It should all have come under consideration on 28 June; it had something to do with the Council presidency, and of course we were happy to do our bit to bolster a Council presidency.
It was a shame, because it would have allowed us to show those responsible for fuels in the Commission that we were prepared to take them on.
We would have been able to show the lobbyists that something which they had thought was completely impossible at the time - I put that on record at the reading here - was actually possible.
You admitted as much as soon as the meeting of the Conciliation Committee was over.
We in Parliament all showed weakness in this regard.
That should not happen again.
The oil industry is experiencing difficulties, not because of European standards, but because of structural problems and many other factors.
I do believe, however, that we have taken a step forward.
There are 200 million motor vehicles in Europe, and my group is firmly in favour of mobility, in contrast to the Green Members.
They would prefer to abolish mobility.
That is the prerequisite of this single market: mobility of persons, goods, products and services.
And because this is what we want, we need highquality fuels, so that we have clean engines and clean exhaust emissions.
There have been some improvements.
On-board diagnostic systems have in no way resulted in car bonnets being locked electronically, as we had feared. This would have prevented medium-sized businesses from carrying out repairs.
I am glad that the testing procedures have been improved.
I am glad that medium-sized businesses will, in many cases, have access to this market.
All in all, the battle is won, but in the future we must show a greater willingness to take on those who are working with us on this European project, so that we can be even more successful for the sake of our children, because they need a healthy environment.
Mr President, I too must start by congratulating Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange most sincerely on this result.
It is largely thanks to them that we have achieved these results, this progress towards better air quality in Europe.
For my part, I believe this is the best thing the European Parliament has done in this area over the last four years.
We have achieved quite a lot in the last four years.
We have of course had to compromise, but the compromises reached have been more in our favour than that of the automobile and oil industry.
In other words, we have won.
Mr Lange has already outlined what has been achieved.
I shall not repeat him.
But when I look at the response of the automobile and petroleum industry to what the Council, Commission and Parliament have achieved by their joint endeavour and compare that with the attitude the industry was taking a year ago, there is a very marked difference.
The loud protest we were hearing a year ago has died down in the face of our shared determination to bring about an improvement in air quality.
That is what happens when the European Parliament speaks clearly and unequivocally.
We were able to approve the amendments by an overwhelming majority.
I shall not go into the results in detail but I would like to say just one thing: the best result of all, I think, is that we have managed to make the limit values for both fuel content and vehicle emissions mandatory for the year 2005.
That will be a good basis for further agreements.
So we shall be more than happy to vote in favour.
Just one remark to end with, Mr President: I am less happy with the Commission, but we shall doubtless come back to that when we talk about the agreement with the motor vehicle industry concerning CO2 emissions.
That is part of the Auto/Oil programme with which I as an individual member and my group are less pleased, but as I say we shall come back to that.
Lastly, a word to my fellow members of Parliament.
I noted that a good many MEPs were absent from the conciliation procedure.
I found it humiliating to be facing a Council of 15 ambassadors, with just four, five or six people on Parliament's side.
So this is a word of exhortation to the House.
Since we have this power of codecision, we should put in an appearance and use it.
Mr President, the Hautala dossier contains three directives, on the quality of fuels and the reduction of exhaust gas emissions from motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles.
The compromise proposed in this joint proposal was achieved following a conciliation procedure and reached after two months of negotiations.
The agreement is based on the levels adopted by the Council for the years 2000 and 2005, but the European Parliament has managed to make them mandatory for 2005 rather than guide levels.
With regard to the Hautala report, the principal issue was the compulsory reduction in sulphur content.
The levels for the year 2000 for unleaded petrol and diesel remain the same as in the Council's common position, which nevertheless includes a European Parliament amendment designed to increase the maximum oxygen content of unleaded petrol.
The specifications for 2005 make the Council's levels obligatory.
For diesel, the sulphur content will be reduced to 5 ppm, a reduction which will be rendered mandatory in the year 2005, whereas the Council simply wanted to start reducing the sulphur content from the year 2005.
For unleaded petrol, the European Parliament has accepted the levels proposed by the Council while making them obligatory.
In addition, for these two fuels, the Council has accepted the principle proposed by the European Parliament to authorise the early introduction, in the year 2000, of petrol and diesel fuels which satisfy the specifications which will be binding from 2005.
In a statement appended to the text, the Commission also indicates its intention to speed up procedures authorising tax incentives for clean fuels.
On this occasion, exemptions are only authorised for sulphur content, until 2003, by way of derogation from the specifications which otherwise apply from the year 2000, and until 2007 by way of derogation from the specifications which otherwise apply for 2005, while therefore respecting the minimum levels stipulated for the year 2000.
Finally, the Commission has also issued a statement indicating that it would consider whether clean fuel is available in sufficient quantities before granting exemptions.
The joint proposal can therefore be seen as acceptable to the extent that it guarantees the presence of superior quality fuel from the year 2005, or even from the year 2000.
Turning to the Lange reports, the text concerns both motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles.
The maximum levels are those proposed by the Council and obligatory from 2005.
Instruments for checking anti-pollution equipment, with which all diesel and petrol vehicles must be fitted, will be available to all garage owners, while the car industry wanted to limit access to authorised dealers.
The same applies to cold starting tests.
As we know that cold starting produces more pollution, we must remain particularly firm on this point.
To conclude, this joint proposal is acceptable to our group.
It has also been approved by all the Member States and the car industry.
Mr President, I naturally welcome this compromise text which resulted from many conciliation meetings and of course congratulate the two rapporteurs on their excellent work.
The European Parliament has shown real determination in the way it has handled this sensitive issue by pushing its environmental demands to the limit while always remaining within the realms of the possible and the realistic.
Negotiations between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and all those involved in and concerned by this issue, should serve as a lesson to us all.
For myself, and I am by no means a newcomer to Parliament, they have served as a lesson on the conciliation procedure.
My hope is that the discussions which are now to begin on CO2 will go equally well.
I therefore propose that the House should give its full support to this text which, in itself, represents considerable progress.
Progress in reducing the sulphur content of fuels, progress in banning leaded petrol and progress in introducing engine technologies which permit the use of fuels with a low sulphur content.
All of this will bring a concrete change to the everyday lives of the Union's citizens.
The task now is to make known these decisions which provide the beginnings of an answer to the air pollution which has become the major challenge for this turn of the century.
In our countries and our constituencies we must lay to rest certain accepted ideas.
I am thinking in particular of the poor image of diesel.
Although this image was justified in the past, we must now acknowledge the huge progress made by car manufacturers to comply with European standards.
We must consider how to make the people and the media understand that, in future, clean diesel will cause less pollution than unleaded petrol. We must do so in cooperation with the car and oil indutries.
The response to this technological challenge does credit to our engineers.
Finally, Mr President, we will not have brought any real solutions to the problem of car pollution until we have dealt with the problem of rejuvenating the fleet.
We all know that this is a major challenge as 20 % of cars are responsible for about 80 % of all car pollution.
We must therefore find new and original measures which do not repeat the mistakes made in France.
It is not a question of making aid dependent upon the purchase of a new vehicle but upon getting rid of the old one, the funding principally coming from Europe.
I am thinking of the LIFE programme for example.
This measure will boost Europe's popularity.
Of that I am sure, being aware of its cost. But rather than constantly depleting our resources by providing a sprinkling here and there, I am convinced that it is politically important to be able, on occasion, to make a big gesture.
Mr President, sincere congratulations to Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange, the rapporteurs, who together with Mr Kenneth Collins have secured an excellent result.
Air pollution is a particularly intractable problem which needs to be tackled using an integrated, systematic and multidisciplinary approach.
It has direct implications for the health of humans, plants and animals.
In the longer term, the threat to the environment will be worldwide, as a result of acidification and climate change.
Consequently, the importance of legislation aimed at cleaner fuels and cleaner vehicles cannot be underestimated.
The outcome of the negotiations which we now have is a resounding success for a European Parliament which has singlemindedly succeeded in setting limit values for vehicle emissions and the quality of petrol and diesel fuels for the year 2005 and beyond.
The Council too, and specifically the UK Presidency, are to be congratulated on this result.
Proper arguments were brought to bear and swift progress was made.
But pleased as we are by this result, it is only one part of the problem, namely air pollution from traffic and transport; rapidly increasing mobility will quickly cancel out the benefit gained.
That calls for a policy on mobility which is geared to sustainable development.
The automobile and petroleum industries now face the major challenge of giving further thought, together with environmental and consumer organisations, to a sustainable technology which can responsibly accommodate the need for mobility.
It is my hope and my expectation that the Council, the Commission and Parliament will be ready to stimulate the debate on this and provide funding for the research that is needed.
Mr President, introducing mandatory limit values for fuels and vehicle emissions throughout Europe will certainly make an essential contribution to keeping our air clean.
The rapporteurs are to be congratulated, above all for their persistence in gaining acceptance of their views.
Of course, the derogation clauses hurt.
In the future, we will have to press for these derogations to be as limited as possible.
Such caution is well advised, as any member of this House knows who was besieged by lobbyists in the run-up to our debates on this directive.
The agreement on the use of on-board diagnostic systems is also gratifying; it constitutes a workable compromise between consumer interests and control systems.
The right of individual Member States to grant preferential tax treatment for earlier improvements should become a major pillar of European environment policy; at some point in the future, this should be taken as a matter of course and no longer have to be negotiated separately.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteurs, and thank all those who served on the Conciliation Committee.
Their task has not been easy, and they have completed it quickly and successfully.
I would, however, like to introduce one further point into the debate.
The Auto-Oil package has, I believe, allowed us to prove for the first time that modern industrial policy is really environment policy. Only by taking account of the environment and recognising the need both to preserve the natural foundations of human life and to protect human health from possible damage can an industrial policy be formulated which will be valid for ten, twenty or fifty years, rather than just one or two.
I believe that we should take this as an example and examine the possibility of putting together similar packages in other sectors.
I think the chemical industry would be very much in favour of a one-off comprehensive regulation, which would allow it to initiate and plan its long-term development - again, not just for the next few years, but for the next ten, twenty or thirty years. It would thus develop in a way consistent with the principle of sustainability, something we have already discussed on many occasions and enshrined in all the Treaties.
A package of this kind makes it possible to balance out interests; it makes it possible to show clearly how the various industries involved in production interact, and to weigh them up against each other; it makes it possible to initiate developments which must, as in the case of Auto-Oil, be undertaken by the motor industry and the fuel industry together.
These are the methods we should adopt, and we should apply them to several sectors. I believe that this is the real policy of the future, industrial policy coupled with environment policy, or rather environment policy which determines industrial policy.
I should not, of course, like to miss this opportunity to note that one of the derogations granted to Austria in the negotiations was extended as part of this package. It means that we will not contravene Union legislation next year either, because we may continue to use fuels with a low benzene content.
One final comment: this was a first step; further steps - also in the field of development and mobility - will follow. They must, for the future of our industry and, above all, for the future of our people.
Mr President, the European Union and the Member States must work closely together and liaise with Europe's motor and oil industries at all times so as to guarantee that pollution is defeated once and for all in the near future.
If the overall social, human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be achieved then strict standards for reducing air pollution must be an imperative.
It is only right and proper that changes be introduced in a structured and coherent manner.
Europe's motor and oil industries must be able to comply with clearly defined targets in any new legislation, to ensure that they can plan in confidence for the next generation of motor vehicles and invest in better refineries.
On reducing exhaust emissions from passenger cars, I support the proposal that systems be installed in new cars from the year 2000 onward to monitor the durability of anti-pollution equipment in passenger vehicles.
Anti-pollution devices must remain effective for at least 80 000 km or five years from the year 2000 onwards, and for at least 100 000 km from 2005.
Tax incentives must be used to encourage the early introduction of vehicles containing advanced anti-pollution equipment.
I also support the proposed directive to improve the quality of petrol and diesel fuels in Europe.
By means of this directive no leaded petrol will be sold anywhere in Europe after January 2000, except where severe socio-economic problems would arise.
Moreover, unleaded petrol and diesel sold after 1 January 2000 will also have to comply with the new environmental specifications.
As a result of this new directive there will be a threefold reduction in the sulphur content of petrol in cars and a seven-fold reduction in the sulphur content of diesel by 2005.
I would like to congratulate the decision of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association to accept a timetable to cut CO2 emissions in new cars by 25 % by the year 2000.
The fact that the Commission does not have to bring forward legislation to push this issue through is an indication that the way forward is by consultation between all the interested parties.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks are due to both our rapporteurs.
I have drafted quite a few reports in my time, but I have never before experienced such a good level of cooperation, producing work with such solid technical foundations, which has been presented in such a comradely spirit!
For more than two years, since the Commission tabled its draft directive, the introduction of clean fuels has been under discussion in Europe.
Parliament has given its views on two occasions, clearly stating what is at stake.
Clean fuels directly contribute to reducing air pollution.
Clean fuels allow modern technology to be used in car engines, which will likewise lead to a substantial reduction in fuel consumption.
It will be remembered that several people were rather unwilling to accept this, and obstinately declared during the course of the negotiations that Parliament's aspirations were unfeasible and far too expensive.
Today, it gives us great satisfaction to hear that several oil companies want to put new fuels on the market as early as the year 2000, fuels which meet the specifications of the 2005 standard as they stand following conciliation.
Obviously, the positive outcome of the conciliation is already bearing fruit, even before entering into force.
The result of the conciliation is a good one.
Above all, the Parliament delegation has managed to gain acceptance of two important proposals.
The specifications for the year 2005 are not mere indicative values; they are mandatory.
In addition, it is also possible to phase in more stringent specifications earlier and, as we have just heard, there are already plans to do so.
The fact that the Council presidencies vied with each other to announce the result of the conciliation can certainly be regarded in a positive light, but even so, this sort of thing should not happen again: if we run short of time, we should not allow some issues to be dropped from the agenda just for the sake of producing a result.
A proportion of 30 ppm of lubricant film in fuel is still a target we should be aiming for, and our specifying 50 ppm at this stage will certainly not delay the development of modern technologies.
That is the upper limit value, after all, and there is nothing to stop people providing better fuels.
The motor vehicle industry is now being asked to lead the way in reducing CO2 emissions in Europe.
That it should do so by means of a voluntary agreement is something which Parliament has already criticised on several occasions.
This is not so much because we are questioning whether the 120 g CO2 /km now on the table is sufficient - I think we can live with that - but because the whole procedure seems to me to be rather lacking in transparency.
We should be aware that such an agreement is replacing a proper legislative procedure, i.e. the adoption of a directive by codecision.
I am rather sceptical about whether this Europe-wide test of voluntary agreements will be successful in terms of CO2 reductions.
All those involved should realise what is at stake here.
If it became necessary to take fiscal measures to reach the targets we have agreed, then I would consider this method to have failed.
Even though we have the possibility of cooperating by adopting legislation on monitoring, we should make it clear that voluntary agreements of this kind should be the exception where the environment is concerned.
Mr President, we are now witnessing the culmination of a long process, the results of which will have a major impact on human health and the environment.
What Parliament did in tightening up the provisions of the Commission's Auto/Oil proposal will, I am sure, be vindicated as wise and balanced. Stricter requirements are to be applied to vehicle specifications and fuel quality by the years 2000 and 2005.
Member States will also be able to introduce economic incentives to speed progress towards a better environment.
Higher quality fuels automatically lead to lower toxic emissions and encourage the development of catalytic converters for larger diesel engines.
Huge reductions in nitrogen emissions can then be achieved.
Let me use this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs on their sterling work.
Mrs Hautala perhaps had the toughest task, but the outcome of her endeavours demonstrates that the EU institutions can work together in the interest of the environment. The overall result is greater than the sum of individual efforts could ever be.
Yet we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. We must build on our success and push ahead along the road towards safer and more environmentally friendly motor cars.
A pro-active approach to the question of fuel consumption can pay dividends.
It should be possible to bring about a 25 % reduction in fuel use by as early as 2005.
In the longer term we are certain to see breakthroughs for the electric and the hybrid car - the latter running on a combination of electric power and internal combustion.
The challenge here is how to produce more electricity without creating greenhouse and other gases.
We should be looking to hydroelectric, wind and nuclear sources.
Mr President, in ten years' time, pollution from the Community's motor vehicles will have been reduced by a total of 70 % compared to what it was in 1990.
That will be the outcome when the package of the Conciliation Committee, covering cars, light commercial vehicles and fuels, is adopted.
It is a major victory, first and foremost for the environment and for the citizens of Europe.
It is a legislative package which, by improving air quality in Europe, will contribute significantly to raising the quality of life of our citizens.
The package is a shining example of how the Community can achieve decisive results for the benefit of the population of Europe.
And, make no mistake, they are results which the Member States could never have achieved on their own.
The package is also a unique example of how we can succeed - if only the will is there - in combining ambitious legislation with the concern to safeguard a competitive European industry.
The package will ensure that not only will industry be able to maintain its position on the European domestic market, it will also hold its own with the best in the world.
I therefore think that it is appropriate today to congratulate Parliament's negotiators, and that applies especially to the two rapporteurs, Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala, who have done an excellent job, but there is also good reason to thank Mrs Fontaine and Mr Collins for their efforts in the conciliation negotiations.
Such a result could - as you all know - only have been achieved thanks to a major, well targeted and competent effort on the part of all concerned, including of course the Council under the British Presidency.
Parliament has obtained quite significant concessions from the Council of Ministers in a range of important areas, such as comitology, mandatory standards for 2005 covering the main parameters, bringing forward the requirement for on-board diagnostic systems in diesel and light commercial vehicles, the early and gradual phasing-in of cleaner fuels and many other things.
In addition, it is a package which is secured for the future, a point that many speakers mentioned in the debate.
It contains provisions which will ensure that emission and fuel requirements beyond the year 2005 will be reviewed in the light of developments in air quality standards and technological possibilities offered by new fuels and propulsion systems in the future.
I must confess that, when I put forward the Auto-Oil package on behalf of the Commission two years ago, I did not think that we would make such progress in such a short time, and I have to thank Parliament for that.
The package is of course a compromise and it was therefore only to be expected that not everyone would achieve what they wanted in every detail.
Viewed as a whole, however, there is no doubt in my mind that the package represents such significant progress that it cannot but be adopted.
It is a particular pleasure for me therefore, on behalf of the Commission, to be able to recommend this ambitious package for adoption.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The sitting will be suspended until voting time, since there would be little point in starting the next debate and then interrupting it after a quarter of an hour.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
VOTES
I would remind the House that the vote on the recommendation for second reading (A4-0278/98) on coffee extracts and chicory extracts, drawn up by Mr Lannoye on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, has been postponed to voting time on Wednesday to enable the rapporteur to reach a compromise with the political groups.
Mr Christodoulou's report (A4-0296/98) will also be put to the vote tomorrow, since the deadline for tabling amendments was only yesterday evening.
Report (A4-0293/98) by Mr Monfils, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of a bilateral agreement between the Community and the Republic of Cyprus on the Republic of Cyprus' participation in a Community programme within the framework of Community audiovisual policy (COM(98)0242 - C4-0428/98-98/0138(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
There is nothing new about attempts to legislate on the legal protection of designs and models, the first proposal for Community legislation dating back to 1993.
As legal traditions in this field are very different, if not divergent, it has been very difficult to arrive at a common position of the Council.
The major practical problem was that of protecting designs of spare parts used in repairs, which created difficulties for many industrial sectors.
The questions raised were so sensitive that the Council finally gave up trying to harmonise the rules.
Whereas some saw this as the antithesis of the single market, I believe it is more reasonable to view it as indicative of the limits to harmonisation.
It is impossible to harmonise all the legislation of 15 countries with their different legal traditions, and it will become even more impossible when the European Union is enlarged to include Eastern European countries which, until recently, were governed by totalitarian communist regimes.
We must not be frightened by this.
Competition can support legislative differences and it is pure fancy to seek a total uniformity which virtually amounts to a fossilising of the law.
Remember that the United States has very different legislation in its various states, and that does not seem to have caused any particular economic weakness!
However, Parliament had wished to include in the directive a 'compensation clause' which would have applied a system which my group and myself judged to be too complex and above all extremely difficult to implement.
This remains our position, and we considered at the time that the Council had been right to oppose this clause.
As no agreement was reached, a conciliation procedure was opened.
At the end of the day, the compensation clause was not adopted, which seems perfectly reasonable to us as it created great legal uncertainty for designers.
The solution adopted was to 'freeze' the legal situation of the Member States while allowing them to evolve in the direction of more flexible protection.
Once the directive is amended, spare parts manufacturers and constructors will be invited to conclude a voluntary agreement on the protection of drawings and spare parts, which we believe is a better solution than compulsory uniformity.
In fact, although we did not vote for this report, this was solely because we were opposed to the compensation clause as it had been formulated. We had not in any way lost faith in what is a successful outcome to the conciliation procedure.
In any event, and although I disagree with the rapporteur on this question, I would like to pay tribute to his work and to the conviction he has shown, even if this has not convinced us that the compensation clause is well founded.
Like my colleagues, I voted in favour of the Conciliation Committee's report on the draft directive concerning the legal protection of designs.
I would like to make it clear, however, that I regret that Parliament's discussion was confined to the economic and financial interests of the car spare parts industry, while existing legal problems were not considered.
Although I welcome the material effect of Parliament's proposed 'repairs clause' as being in the interests of the consumer, introducing it would have thrown all the principles of intellectual property protection overboard.
This compromise also gives us grounds to hope for a legally sound solution in the long term.
I am in full support of effective protection of designs in the EU Member States.
It is a positive development that the legal obstacles to the free exchange of designs are now being removed.
This initiative is absolutely essential to the maintenance of free competition on the internal market.
The fact that there was nevertheless substantial opposition to the directive is due to the disagreement over freedom to protect designs for spare parts.
I myself consistently advocated the view that there should be unimpeded freedom without remuneration to produce and use nonoriginal spare parts with no time-lag for the spare-part manufacturers.
The compromise represented by the text of the Conciliation Committee does not entirely accommodate this view, but I hope that in the longer term it will be possible to achieve improved rules in the spare-part sector with a view to incorporating them into the directive.
I am relieved that agreement on this important legislation has at last been reached between our negotiators from the European Parliament and the Member State governments.
It is of course the question of a 'repairs clause' which has proved the most thorny aspect of the new design directive.
I am glad to see that no obstacle will be allowed to hinder the free movement of the vehicle spare parts which in Britain many repair businesses use every day.
Whilst I recognise that the 'standstill plus' formula of this compromise agreement means that other countries could stick to their practices of forcing vehicle owners to go to the manufacturer when they need spare parts, I would recommend that they consider opening up the market in spare parts to garages and the like.
The customer in Britain benefits from the competition between manufacturers and repair companies when it comes to buying vehicle spare parts.
I believe that all European drivers should be able to choose their spare part supplier in the interests of fair competition.
From Parliament's point of view, neither the conciliation procedure itself nor its result can be said to be satisfactory.
At first, the Council was dilatory in dealing with this important bill, the Luxembourg Presidency passing it on to the British Presidency.
In the course of the negotiations, it became clear that it would not be possible to reach agreement on the contentious 'repairs clause'.
In the light of the obvious lack of political will to find a common solution to an issue which is so important for the single market, we have to agree with the rapporteur that, on the one hand, the current proposal will allow a common EU-wide legal basis for design protection to be made available to all the sectors concerned, but that on the other hand, it will not allow the legal situation of the repairs industry to deteriorate.
My group therefore voted in favour of the Conciliation Committee's draft decision.
Lange report (A4-0314/98)
I welcome this report and agree with the rapporteur that the importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated.
Reductions in vehicle emission are an absolute necessity and the report reflects sensible proposals which will achieve that.
I fully agree with the introduction of on-board diagnostic systems for all vehicles including diesel vehicles and light commercial vehicles.
This is exactly the sort of preventive measures which we need to put in place if we are to minimise environmental pollution.
It is also reasonable to phase in the application of on-board diagnostics.
The rapporteur has shown due regard to public concern in pushing the case for more environmentally friendly vehicles.
While we need to address the problem of how to address pollution from vehicles currently on the road, most of us would agree that the best way forward is the development of a culture of environmentally friendly vehicles.
In this regard I support the proposal for tax incentives to be introduced for the early production of vehicles which have advanced anti-pollution equipment.
Hautala report (A4-0313/98)
The Conciliation Committee is presenting a package of anti-pollution measures today which involves a series of important economic consequences.
Thanks to Parliament's efforts, three texts have been adopted.
From these is derived a directive which is directly descended from the recent Auto-Oil programme, an operation which involved the Commission and the motor and oil industries as well as our Parliament.
The priority objective today is to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and that includes defining a European strategy for the reduction of vehicle emissions, through the launching, at long last, of absolutely clear Community legislation, which will consequently allow industry - especially the motor industry - to plan its sectoral investment with a view to the conversion needed to produce future generations of motor vehicles.
The oil industry, with a kind of self-protective attitude, appears to exaggerate the cost of the investment it considers necessary to prepare the construction of new refineries, which it claims will be a direct burden on motorists. However, we believe that the establishment of rules which actually provide tax reductions for motorists - the main consumers in the sector - may in the end make the necessary investment possible.
The agreement between the Council and Parliament will make it technically possible to improve the quality of the air, thanks to the compulsory provision for adding oxygen to diesel fuel, reducing the content of sulphur, benzene and aromatic substances in normal fuel and reducing emissions of anhydrous carbon.
Under the terms of the directive, leaded fuel will no longer be on sale after the year 2000, except where climatic conditions are favourable to its use or where very serious economic damage might be caused.
Furthermore, unleaded petrol and environmental diesel will have to obey stricter criteria as from January 2000.
The terms envisaged are reasonably binding, especially as application will have to be made to the Commission, which will be very sparing in granting derogations and will only do so after duly justified requests and for a very limited period.
The Auto-Oil directives had been the subject of considerable discussion and aroused some agitation in the world of industry.
While nobody disputes the need to protect the environment, it must be admitted that this also has a cost which it would be unreasonable to ignore.
After two readings in Parliament, the common position was sent to the Conciliation Committee.
It is this proposal, unanimously adopted by Parliament's delegation, which has been submitted to us.
The compromise achieved lies between the positions of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.
An extreme ecologist position, unreasonable in economic terms, has thus been avoided.
Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that the specifications adopted are significantly more severe that those initially adopted by the European Commission.
The standards adopted by the Council of Ministers for implementation from 2005 were originally for guidance purposes only. They are now to be made binding.
Most fiercely debated were the specifications for sulphur and aromatics.
It must be admitted that a major effort is being demanded of the oil and car industries.
For this reason, the European legislators must give these industries a guarantee that these standards will be stable and not embark on a race towards ever stricter standards, especially as technological innovations do not make it any easier. We must avoid creating industrial costs which are disproportionate to the benefits in terms of improvements to the environment.
As this common position represents an acceptable compromise, in terms of industrial constraints and protection of the environment, my group had no hesitation in approving it.
As I demonstrated during the debate in Parliament on 17 February this year, I am in favour of the Hautala report.
I am practically the only one who supports it among the Members from my Member State, and today I am again reiterating my support for the agreement reached between the Council and Parliament in the Conciliation Committee on the quality of fuels from the year 2000 and the year 2005. This is because, as I have already said here in the House and am going to repeat today, cleaner fuels, that is, fuels that cause less pollution, are a crucial step forward in defending the health of European citizens.
Today, as before, my vote is going in the same direction: giving priority to health and to the quality of the air we breathe, and not to the private interests of certain oil companies.
We choose to support the common position because more stringent requirements for the reduction of vehicle emissions will lead to a reduction in air pollutants and hence will benefit human health and the environment.
The identification of the need for a strategy to reduce emissions causing air pollution, with special reference to urban areas, we think reflects a responsible environmental policy because it is in urbanised areas that these problems are particularly acute.
We also think it is a step in the right direction that individual Member States should in special cases be able to require that fuels may only be marketed if they conform to more stringent environmental specifications than those laid down in the directive.
This upholds the right of the Member States to adopt environmental measures that go further than those adopted by the Community.
The encouragement of Member States to make more active use of fiscal incentives, in the form of differentiated excise duties, we think opens up attractive possibilities for the heavier taxation of substances which are especially polluting.
We would, however, point out that there is a problem in that individual Member States cannot act to differentiate excise duties without reference to Council decisions.
The concern for a better environment must not be used as a pretext for increased harmonisation of excise duties.
This is a very positive report. It promotes the two-phase introduction of stricter mandatory emission standards by the years 2000-2005.
Tax incentives may be used in individual member states to encourage the refitting or scrapping of older vehicles.
More stringent monitoring will be carried out of emission levels.
The ban on lead from 1 January 2000, as proposed in the Hautala report, will improve petrol and diesel quality.
Member States will be free to introduce tougher requirements, plus a differentiated system of excise duties.
So far, so good.
I also voted in favour of the reports, but what we really need is a strategy for getting petrol- and diesel-driven vehicles off our roads.
As an alternative, we should be looking to new clean fuels such as ethanol and methanol, and to means of transport which are powered in an environmentally friendly way. Examples would be the electric car and various types of hybrid vehicle capable of running off electricity in cities and built-up areas.
González Triviño recommendation (A4-0295/98)
The report by our colleague Mr Triviño comes at a particularly painful time, and we can only express our condolences to the families affected by the Swissair tragedy.
This recent tragic event makes the report even more pertinent, and we must acknowledge that the risks of air transport apply to all airlines, without exception.
Also, although there is no such thing as zero risk, our sole objective must nevertheless be to strive towards this result, and I welcome the amendments which the rapporteur is seeking to introduce to the Council's text.
In this respect, I share the Commission's desire for transparency which enables the consumer to choose in full knowledge of the facts.
We must also combat deregulation and the law of the jungle on prices which lower safety thresholds.
Finally, I would like to repeat that air travel is one of the safest means of transport, if not the safest of all, and I believe the European Parliament must not lose sight of the need to legislate in other sectors, in particular road transport, in order to significantly reduce the carnage we see on our roads every year.
Remember that there are fewer than 2000 deaths a year worldwide in aircraft accidents. In France alone, there are 8000 deaths a year on the roads.
I am happy to lend my support to the efforts of both our national governments and the author of this report to make our skies safer for the travelling public, airline staff and all of us who live under the flightpaths of Europe's busy airports.
It is only reasonable to demand that non-European aircraft using our airspace meet the highest safety standards.
This report is right to ask for swift inspections of such aircraft where the authorities have concerns that they may not meet international safety standards.
Just as important though is the call in this report for the public to be informed about those aircraft operators whose planes are grounded, as well as being told what corrective steps have been taken to put problems with these aircraft right.
Perhaps all MEPs speaking on this subject should declare an interest, as we need to use air travel to carry out our parliamentary duties at home and here in Strasbourg - but in truth all of us, whether we use air travel or not, have a vital interest in the safety of the aircraft that we see flying above our homes.
I know that the people I represent in the area around the busy Manchester Airport will want these safety proposals to be adopted as soon as possible.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.25 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Climate change
The next item is the Commission statement on its strategy following the Kyoto Conference on climate change.
I give the floor to Mrs Bjerregaard, for the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of preparations for the ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires, I am happy to be able to speak to you today on climate change.
Of course I hope that a few more Members will be here in due course.
Both in Rio and in Kyoto the EU showed that, by taking a lead, we can secure agreement on a problem of such global complexity as climate change, even though the positions of the main participants at the start were far apart.
The EU can also deliver results when it comes to its internal obligations.
The most recent data show that the Community is well on the way to stabilising CO2 emissions in the year 2000 at the 1990 level.
Since Kyoto, the EU has dealt with the matter at the highest political level.
We have continued our lead and sought to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol will take effect.
Let me just mention four milestones.
To begin with, the EU and its Member States signed the Protocol in April this year.
Now everything is being done to persuade the other parties to sign as well.
It is of crucial significance that the American Government and the Russian Federation are showing the political will to stand by their commitments and are signing the Protocol.
That should happen as far as possible before Buenos Aires.
When I meet the American and, I hope also, the Russian ministers in a few days, therefore, I shall be pressing for an informal ministerial meeting in Tokyo.
In that connection, I was pleased at the efforts made by Parliament to persuade Members of the American Congress to ratify the Protocol.
That is an important point, and we should all work to achieve a result.
Secondly, we succeeded at the Council meeting on the environment in June in reaching agreement on sharing the burden of the EU target among the Member States.
That is also an important message to the rest of the world.
Thirdly, I published a communication on climate change in June which lays down the first steps in an outline strategy on climate change for the EU.
Fourthly and finally, I held a meeting yesterday with all the ten applicant countries in which the very subject of climate and the meeting in Buenos Aires were high on the agenda.
I am happy to report to Parliament that there is full backing for the EU's line and that there is the political will to support it.
Many of the countries will also be ensuring that the Protocol is signed before Buenos Aires.
These four concrete actions have of course increased the EU's credibility, and that makes it possible to continue our lead.
It is our intention to get Kyoto put into effect, so now we can concentrate on those questions which must be resolved in Buenos Aires.
What do we want from Buenos Aires?
Well, in my opinion the meeting is of the utmost importance in securing a common action plan which will map out the basic principles for the implementation of the Protocol.
The EU must again take the strain in ensuring that we make substantial progress in Buenos Aires, even in some of the difficult areas.
I hope to return from Buenos Aires with a comprehensive and ambitious action plan, together with a timetable for solving the remaining problems from Kyoto.
In any such action plan, we must be open to those which may help us to achieve our environmental objectives over a longer timescale, including the flexibility mechanisms.
In this context, the set of principles indicated in the resolution is also particularly interesting and merits further consideration.
However, we should not foster any illusions that it will be easy to find solutions when we have the so-called umbrella group, on the one hand, headed by the USA, which is calling for unrestricted application of the flexibility mechanisms, and G77 and China, on the other hand, which are committed to a more cautious and controlled application.
We must also not forget the other controversy influencing the negotiations, which has to do with a meaningful involvement of the developing countries as a condition for ratification by the USA.
Here, as in Kyoto, it may be EU leadership that secures a result.
And here I agree with Parliament that we must grasp every available opportunity for a dialogue.
However, let me take this opportunity to stress that early action on the home front remains one of the cornerstones of the Kyoto Protocol and one of the most important contributions to the fulfilment of the parties' obligations.
An important element in the national endeavours, not least in the EU, will therefore be joint and coordinated measures.
For that reason, I am particularly pleased that Parliament in its resolution refers to the need for economic and fiscal instruments.
In many areas, the EU is in the lead as regards energy and carbon taxes, environmental agreements with industry and the promotion of renewable energy sources.
We have already made progress in this way in combating emissions, and call on other countries to follow our example.
I am aiming to secure further progress on these issues in Buenos Aires, also on the principles we have worked out, and get them reflected in the action plan that we hope will be adopted.
In its communication on climate change, the Commission has defined a number of key principles regarding the flexibility mechanisms.
I am convinced that they can play a major role in fulfilling our commitments at least cost.
I therefore endorse the emphasis in the resolution on the need to use this flexibility.
I would, however, stress that flexibility which covers trade and other activities presupposes that the participants are able to monitor their own emissions - in other words, no trade without tracking.
It is crucial that we make progress in Buenos Aires on laying down the rules which are the precondition for flexibility mechanisms.
Let me further stress that strict supervision, hence also the possibility of imposing sanctions, must go hand in hand with the implementation of the Protocol.
If there is any relaxation in the enforcement of the Protocol, so that some get a free ride on the strength of other countries' efforts, we shall never be able to combat the effects of climate change.
I therefore urge the participants in Buenos Aires to agree on the rules for the implementation of the agreement.
Finally, it is my firm conviction that it is incumbent on the industrialised countries first and foremost to present proposals for the solution of the climate problem in practice.
Wecreated it after all.
Once we have worked out clear rules and secured strict enforcement of the flexibility mechanisms, it will make much more sense to talk to the developing countries about their obligations.
Until then, we must work more closely with them on the questions that preoccupy them most, such as mechanisms for sustainable development and technology transfer.
In order to follow up the meeting in Buenos Aires, and taking into account the national strategies which the Member States adopt, the Commission intends to present a wider-ranging implementation strategy for climate change in the first half of 1999.
An important step in the meantime will be for the Council to adopt as quickly as possible those proposals which are already on the table, for example the Commission's proposal for energy taxes or the proposals for a more effective transport policy.
I also expect that the climate change question will be gradually integrated into policies in other sectors, as requested by the European Council at its meeting in Vienna.
Mr President, I will close by thanking Parliament once again for the constructive efforts it has made to disseminate knowledge of the climate change problem, and for the support it has given to the Commission with a view to implementation.
Mr President, I should like to thank you for your statement, Commissioner and, before the beginning of the debate, recall once more the five principles on which the actual rules on climate protection, agreed in Rio, are based: the principle of common but differentiated responsibility; the principle of taking account of the special needs of developing countries; the precautionary principle; the principle of sustainable development; and the principle that measures taken to combat climate change have to comply with WTO rules on avoiding unjustified discrimination.
It is this last point in particular that I wish to recall, because if we are going to talk about solidarity and fairness in this debate, and if we are going to say - and here I can only reinforce what you said, Commissioner - that it is necessary for industrialised countries who, after all, have produced and still do produce high emissions of climate-damaging gases, to work harder at reducing them and set a good example - as we are trying to do in the European Union with the 'bubble', where we are also taking common but differentiated responsibility - then we also have to be fair when we are dealing with the various flexibility mechanisms.
We must state clearly here, as already stated in the Kyoto Protocol, that these must be additional and not exclusive measures. We also need clear indications of how emissions trading will be monitored and measured.
The same method of measurement must be used throughout the world, to avoid the developing countries thinking that the industrialised countries want to save themselves work, at their expense as it were, for a second time.
Technology transfer is a particularly important issue, and I eagerly await the action plan, because I believe that we in the Union can only assume the role of leader here if we ourselves forge ahead with measures, which in the end not only serve to protect the climate, but in actual fact also serve to modernise our economy.
Political will is presumably the most decisive factor, and I believe - as Mrs Brundtland said many years ago - that if the politicians making today's decisions will not be alive when the consequences of their decisions are known, then we politicians who are alive today have a duty to act differently, so that the climate does not change as much as it is feared it would do, if it was simply business as usual.
Thank you for your statement, Commissioner.
The Group Chief Executive of British Petroleum (BP) said yesterday that the oil companies would suffer if they continued to dismiss the evidence of climate change.
It is high time that Exxon and the other oil companies in the Global Climate Coalition realised that, if they do not change their attitude, they will have to face retaliatory measures by European consumers.
We have not acted in this way so far, but we may have to start down this road, because this group of companies is the main obstacle to the implementation of the Kyoto decisions.
Turning now to the text of the resolution which Parliament is going to adopt, it is plain that this is a very different animal from previous resolutions.
This text aims to establish a strategy for Buenos Aires, particularly with regard to the flexibility mechanisms, and does not just reaffirm our completely unaltered position on climate change.
We accept the full implementation of the Kyoto decisions, including the flexibility mechanisms or emissions trading.
However, these mechanisms must obey certain principles.
Firstly, they must be complementary and not absolute, which means that they must not under any circumstances replace domestic measures for reducing emissions.
Secondly, the overall objective of all the efforts of Kyoto and Buenos Aires is to obtain, in time, the progressive convergence of emission rights on a per capita basis among all the countries of the world.
It is right for this to be included, because the United States and Europe have a per capita share of emissions which is much higher than the per capita emissions of many of the countries of the world.
Thirdly - and this is important for Buenos Aires - it is essential to clarify the emissions trading, joint implementation and clean development mechanisms.
What is open for negotiation?
This is not clear at the moment.
Who will do the negotiating?
By what amount should each emission right be reduced over the years?
Who controls the emission rights and the way in which companies comply with the obligations of the trading mechanism?
None of this is clear to me at the moment and, so far, I have not seen any European Union positions which enlighten me as to the stance which will be taken in Buenos Aires.
It must also be made clear that the emissions trading mechanisms cannot just be full of hot air.
Commissioner, we are behind you. We support your attempts to ensure that a policy reversing climate change is adopted by the Members of the Commission.
So far this has not occurred.
The ecotaxes are at a standstill in the Council, but the Commission could already have done more.
The policy in favour of renewable energy and energy efficiency continues to exist only in statements and communications and has not yet been transformed into a mechanism, into an operational policy of the European Union.
We are behind you, Commissioner, but we are watching carefully.
Mr President, Kyoto was a great success, partly due to the powerful input of Commissioner Bjerregaard.
But now it is all to do again in Buenos Aires.
These flexible mechanisms have to be worked out.
We have to look at 'joint implementation', at the 'clean development mechanism', at 'emissions trading' and all these flexible mechanisms, and if they can be sorted out satisfactorily this will hopefully persuade the United States to come into line on Kyoto and actually do something about the CO2 problem.
We have looked here at all manner of important questions - sinks, trading, hot air - all of which need to be resolved in Buenos Aires.
But above all, and here I agree with Mr Pimenta, something has to be done about caps.
We must ensure that countries do not use emissions trading as a way of getting round the domestic measures which they ought to take.
So this emissions trading must be subject to a ceiling.
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she will clarify her intentions in this regard.
Lastly, I note that the transport sector accounts for some 25 % of greenhouse gases and that this percentage is set to rise further.
By the year 2010 it will be 40 %.
Looking at the voluntary agreement with the automobile industry, it just is not good enough.
I should like to hear what the Commissioner has to say about the voluntary agreement she has secured here with the automobile industry concerning CO2 .
In conclusion, I would urge the Commissioner to make Buenos Aires as big a success as Kyoto was.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not expect you to contribute to the increase in hot air, Commissioner, but to give us clear information.
Like a number of other colleagues, I would have liked to know what the guidelines actually say.
On the one hand, you spoke about 'milestones' and 'taking action at home', but on the other, you repeatedly emphasised the flexibility mechanisms.
How extensive should domestic measures be, compared with flexibility mechanisms?
In Kyoto you talked about a ratio of 50/50, and the Greens have tabled an amendment to that effect which will be put to the vote on Thursday.
I would be grateful if you could tell us clearly what the ratio is and what your position is on the amendment tabled by the Greens.
I actually believe that the Environment Committee's motion for a resolution does not go far enough.
To us it is tantamount to an act of political bankruptcy as far as climate protection is concerned, because it means that we are bowing to the interests of industry and the United States.
Reference is in fact made here to a quantitative ceiling on flexibility, but unfortunately, Mr Pimenta, the motion never once mentions the tax on energy and CO2 emissions.
We made a proposal for specific measures and for a demonstration model.
Unfortunately, it was not supported by a majority of the committee.
On the subject of emissions trading, the motion reads as though it had been dictated by the USA.
It states that unlimited emissions trading should be possible.
That is a complete reversal of policy on climate protection in this House.
This is shameful, because to fail to set limits on emissions trading is to undermine the Kyoto Protocol.
We all know that it is cheaper for industrialised countries to buy hot air, than to implement even the simplest energy-saving measures at home.
We are opposing this about-turn on climate protection policy, because we know that giving up a consistent climate policy with its associated measures also means losing our leading role.
Without action on climate both at national and European level, emissions will have increased by at least 8 % by the year 2010, rather than, as promised at Kyoto, being reduced by 8 %.
I too should like to endorse what Mr Eisma said, and ask the Commissioner to say a few words about the voluntary commitment made by the motor vehicle industry.
I find the current proposal absurd.
I do not believe that we can talk of success, when we are giving the industry 22 years to reduce petrol consumption by just one single litre.
That is, I believe, a failure for climate policy.
It really is high time to take action!
Mr President, let me remind you that we went to Kyoto with the goal of reducing DEU emissions by 15 %.
Let me also remind you that the IPCC says that we need a 60 % reduction of emissions by the year 2100.
Let me also remind you that we all agreed that in the long term the emission rights all over this planet should be measured on a per capita basis.
Article 3(3) suggests that afforestation and reafforestation measures could be taken into account in order not to reduce our quota of emissions.
On the other hand we have the clear development mechanism which allows non-Annex I countries to become partners and allows us to finance projects which are targeted to reduce emissions in non-Annex I countries - developing countries, etc.
There is a big risk: the threat to biodiversity.
Plantations in non-Annex I countries could be financed by industrialised countries. We have seen what that has led to in Indonesia.
I should like to refer to the excellent paper of the Austrian presidency concerning forestry - the paper which was submitted to the subsidiary body for scientific and technical advice.
The Austrian presidency says that we have always to consider the biodiversity issue.
It also says that forest management should not be taken into account to meet commitments for Article 3(3).
This is a guarantee that no country can continue to convert forests into fast-growing plantations.
We should stick to that line and congratulate the Austrians for making this proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 15 000 US scientists recently signed a petition categorically refuting the concept of the greenhouse effect as purveyed by the media.
They claim, with the evidence to back them up, that the increase in carbon dioxide during the 20th century has had no negative impact on global meteorology, on climate and temperature, and that the predictions of catastrophe are not borne out by experience.
On the contrary, there has been a distinct acceleration in the growth rate of plants and thus in agricultural production.
However, nobody has been able to escape the global propaganda on the greenhouse effect.
The official thesis is that carbon dioxide emissions are warming the planet.
A series of misfortunes will befall us if we do not quickly close the Pandora's box of industry.
The polar icecaps and glaciers will melt, sea levels rise, low-lying ground and many islands will be submerged, tornadoes will increase in number and in violence, tropical storms will penetrate to our own regions, rainfall patterns will be disturbed, droughts will increase and render entire countries barren, etc., etc.
It remains to be seen, Mr President, what are in fact, behind this catastrophic vision, the true interests of the internationalist lobby which has created this global threat.
I am not speaking about the greenhouse effect, but the global socialisation of the economy, by means of ecological standards which will apply to some countries and not to others.
The developing countries which will soon be producing 50 % of greenhouse gases have been exempted, which one can understand, from any need to reduce their emissions.
Is this not, and I ask the question seriously, a new type of threat?
The US scientists have organised a response, under the authority of Frederick Seitz, a former President of the US Academy of Sciences.
Mr President, even if your criticisms were correct, Mr Gollnisch, it would still make sense to save energy.
By so doing, we save our resources and reduce our dependence on imports.
At the end of the day, whether the climatologists are right or not is a scientific issue, and not something that can be decided in a parliament.
Here, it is more a question of taking precautionary measures.
For the first time, we politicians are faced with a very plausible-sounding hypothesis, to which we have to react, and if we do not react, then we might make the biggest mistake ever made by humanity.
That is why I think it is good that there is, after all, a relatively broad consensus in Europe in favour of reducing greenhouse gases.
Now I should like to address a few remarks to the Commission.
It was a good speech, Commissioner, congratulations, and I also believe that you meant what you said.
However, in the end, it is not the success of our speeches that will be measured, but that of our policy instruments.
We will measure to see whether we really have emitted fewer greenhouse gases or not.
And that is where I have my doubts.
Because what we are trying to do in Europe is to stabilise in an unstable situation. Take the transport sector, for example: cars are improving, but there are more cars, and in a few years' time, CO2 emissions from cars will presumably be much higher than they are today, even though each car is consuming a little less.
Households have not seen any change at all.
Household appliances are certainly improving, that is true, but households are increasing, both in size and number, because families are becoming smaller.
You can check up on all of this.
The Commission has carried out its own investigations and has described all this itself.
I am only referring to your own data.
This means that we have to go much further than the commitments made in our papers at present.
We have to translate them into practical policy.
That quickly brings us to the question - not of recognising the issues, we are all agreed on those - but of funding.
How do we finance technology, which is of course often available, in such a way that it will be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
In my experience, at least, this raises just one question: how to fund long- or medium-term programmes.
We are in a position to finance the Channel Tunnel, in such a way that those putting in the money only see a return on it in umpteen years' time.
Why are we not able to prefinance improvements to our buildings in Europe, thus saving huge amounts of energy?
It would be worth it!
Even with low energy prices, we are obviously not in a position to do this.
We have often made lofty declarations on renewable sources of energy too, but I still do not know how that is supposed to work.
You have my support on this, but how can it be done, given the low energy prices we have at present and the rightly criticised lack of an energy tax?
Ecological tax reform is a sine qua non for changing the course of energy policy.
Finally, a piece of advice for Buenos Aires.
In Kyoto, the fact that the American representatives presented a united front proved to work very much to their advantage.
Would it not be possible for the Europeans to form a single team, comprising national and European members of Parliament and the Commission, and to present a united front in Buenos Aires?
After all, our views are, to a large extent, the same.
But we could play a much greater role there if we were more organised.
That is a plea to Parliament, but also to the Commission.
Mr President, unless the Kyoto Protocol is ratified and comes into force within the next few years, we shall in all probability never see the reduction targets achieved in practice.
The reason for that is that a race against time has been built into the Protocol.
For every year that passes with emissions of greenhouse gases still rising, the need for action becomes greater and the time to take that action shorter.
In the USA, for example, the postponement of ratification by three years will mean that the annual reduction effort almost doubles.
It is thus very worrying to hear reports that the Clinton Administration is considering deferment of ratification until after the next presidential elections.
Such a decision will only serve the interests of those who want to see the Kyoto Protocol overturned.
It will not be many years before proposals for a renegotiation of the commitments can be expected to find favour.
This Parliament should not just give its formal support to the work on climate, but should also make an especially concrete contribution to seeing that the results attained are converted into progress in the real world.
I have therefore tabled an amendment with the actual wording of the Kyoto Protocol to the joint resolution, and I hope that Parliament will vote for my amendment.
Mr President, Commissioner, the EU undeniably played a decisive role at Kyoto.
Without Europe's constructive input, the conference might well have been a failure.
We have nurtured a delicate plant; let us now ensure that we tend it in Buenos Aires in December.
In its communication 'Climate Change - Towards an EU Post-Kyoto Strategy', the Commission outlines what will be required to meet the Union's ambitious target of an 8 % reduction in CO2 emissions by 2008-2012.
This will not be feasible in my view without some kind of economic leverage, for example in the shape of a carbon tax.
